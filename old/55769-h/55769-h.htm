<h3><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>


<p>"Why should art answer for the
infirmities of manners?" asks
Thomas Nash in defending the
memory of his dead comrade,
Robert Greene, against the
attacks of Gabriel Harvey.
Some such consideration as
this has been needed to rescue
Greene's fame from the uncritical hostility of later times.
It has been the misfortune of the man to be remembered
by posterity chiefly through adverse personal documents.
The assaults of a frustrate and dying man on a successful
rival like curses soon turned home to roost. Gabriel
Harvey, the Kenrick of his day, crowned the dead poet
with bays more pathetic than the sordid wreath placed
by Isam's hand. And to complete the tale of disfavour
Greene himself tells his own story with a morbid self-consciousness
only exceeding Bunyan's, and a thrifty
purpose to turn even his sins to pence. Though during
Greene's life and after his death circumstances were unmeet
to dispassionate biography, it may promote the
calmer mood of a later age to inquire into the conditions
of his disordered career and the sources of his unique
genius. "Debt and deadly sin, who is not subject to?"
cries Nash. "With any notorious crime I never knew him
tainted." Nash refers Greene back to human nature.
With Nash, at the best but lukewarm, and with Symonds,
no partisan of Greene's, one believes that circumstances
as well as natural frailty made Greene what he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
to be. And of truth he must be represented as no
isolated figure, but as a man of his times, frail, no doubt,
but frail with Marlowe and Peele, versatile with Sidney
and Raleigh, reflective with Spenser, and lusty with
Shakespeare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Greene represents the Elizabethan age at its
best and its worst. What was best in it he helped to
consummate. Of the worst he was the victim as well
as the exemplar. Greene's life comprises and almost
defines the greatest era of expansion known in English
drama. Shakespeare's debt to his predecessors is great
not only on account of direct literary influences. The
best things his forerunners had done for him were to free
the drama from the regulations of a didactic art, to
provide the dramatist a cultivated audience at home in
the great popular play-houses of the metropolis, and
somewhat to relieve the stage from the awful stigma that
had rested on the callings of the actor and the playwright.
When Greene was at preparatory school and at Cambridge
didactic purpose still dominated popular plays. In
<i>The Conflict of Conscience</i> (1560), <i>King Darius</i> (1565),
<i>The Life and Repentance of Mary Magdalene</i> (1566),
and <i>Jacob and Esau</i> (1568) moral drama was late represented.
Even in tragedy, and serious drama on secular
subjects, the didactic element persisted in Preston's
<i>Cambises</i> (1569), and in Edward's <i>Damon and Pithias</i>
(1571). Only in Gascoigne did pure art speak for itself.
He indeed "broke the ice" for the greater poets who
followed him, but he was a translator, and not an original
dramatist. The most promising writer before 1586 was
Robert Wilson. Critics have seen in his <i>The Three Ladies
of London</i> (1584) the mingling of the old morality and the
new art, yet Wilson shows his subserviency to the
demands of his time by making this "a perfect pattern
for all estates to look into," and by presenting the allegory
of three abstractions&mdash;Lucre, Love and Conscience. Six
years later his continuation of this play was frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
called a "Moral." Greene himself shows the same
motive in <i>A Looking-Glass for London and England</i> and in
<i>James IV.</i>; and the late appearance of such plays as <i>A
Warning for Fair Women</i> (1599), and <i>A Larum for London</i>
(1602) testifies to the vitality of the didactic element
in drama long after the exponents of a new art had arisen.</p>

<p>It is not strange, perhaps, that it was university men
who served to free the drama to the better purposes of
art. Themselves trained in the classics, and in the
essentials of Italian culture, they were able to bring to
bear on drama the force of the influence of Seneca, the
pastoral, and the masque, and thereby greatly to increase
the range of inspiration and the instruments of effective
expression open to the playwrights. The fact is, however,
worthy of remark that it is to the university playwrights
that we have to credit the transference of the
patronage of the drama out of the hands of the court into
the hands of the people. Lyly had been the first great
university dramatist. His plays, of which <i>Campaspe</i>
and <i>Sapho and Phao</i> must have been composed
before 1581, were written for court production. But
Lyly's own melancholy story shows clearly enough that if
dramatists were to flourish at all they needed means of
support supplementary to the uncertain pension of a
noble. It was for the sake of this further support that
the playwrights and the actors proceeded to perform
their court plays before the people, first in the inn-yards
of the Cross Keys, the Bull and the Bell Savage, and
finally in the Theatre and the Curtain, erected in 1576
and 1577 in Finsbury Fields. As an indication of the
movement to transfer the support of the drama from
the court to the public it is recorded that in 1575
"Her Majesty's poor players" were petitioning the Lord
Mayor, through the Privy Council, for permission to play
within the city, assigning as reasons the fact that they
needed rehearsal properly to prepare for their court
appearances, and that they needed to earn their livings.
The answer of the city authorities, that plays should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
presented by way of recreation by men with other means
of subsistence, was manifestly an avoidance of the implications
of the situation at hand.</p>

<p>It was not until after the plague of 1586, and the return
of the companies from the provinces, that the university
playwrights rose to a commanding place in the life of the
time. And then, though their plays were still performed
at court, it was to the people that the dramatists made
their appeal. Marlowe, and Greene, and Peele and
Lodge now constituted the group of the university wits.
The support that the court had before either withheld, or
but fitfully given, was now vouchsafed liberally at the
Theatre and the Curtain. The university dramatists
knew well what was demanded of them. Dismissing
the topics treated by Lyly, and by Peele in his early play,
<i>The Arraignment of Paris</i> (1584), and discarding by
degrees the allegorical and didactic as found in
the popular drama of the preceding time, they began
to dramatise the spirit of contemporary life in the
form of stories built from legend and romance, and
instinct with the leonine spirit of awakening England.
Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i> is as true to Elizabethan
England as is Dekker's more realistic <i>Shoemaker's
Holiday</i>; and Peele's <i>Old Wives' Tale</i> and Greene's
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> are both native in
England's soil. In the years between 1584 and 1593
the number of companies greatly increased. Fleay
mentions nine companies as performing at court between
these dates. Besides the Queen's players, who comprised,
perhaps, two or more companies, there were
companies of my Lord Admiral, Pembroke, Sussex and
other lords. Normally the playwrights wrote only for
the company to which they were attached. It is believed
that at one time Lodge, Peele, Marlowe and Greene were
together as playwrights for the Queen's men playing at
the Theatre. Later the first three went over to the support
of the Admiral's men, and thereafter often changed
their allegiance, but Greene probably wrote only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Queen's players until his death. Soon other dramatists
aligned themselves with the movements of the new
drama, and out of the jealous rivalry aroused by the
entrance into the field of dramatic authorship of such
non-university playwrights as Kyd and Shakespeare there
developed the maze of controversy and vituperation that
has made the Elizabethan age famous as an era of personal
pamphleteering.</p>

<p>But though the drama was occupying an increasingly
prominent place in the life of the time the professional
actors and playwrights were in decided ill-repute. With
the managers and with the actors the returns from the
stage were sufficient to salve the hurt of the odium under
which their profession rested. Richard Burbage died a
rich man, and Alleyn, who played in at least one of
Greene's plays, became so wealthy that he could found a
college. So also, as we learn from the slighting references
to them by the dramatists, the actors were well able to line
their pockets with the returns of their calling. But the
pamphlet literature of the time reveals the extraordinary
hostility with which all connected with the theatre were
viewed. Gosson's <i>School of Abuse</i> (1579), <i>A Second and
Third Blast of Retrait from Plays and Theatres</i> (1580),
Stubb's <i>Anatomy of Abuses</i> (1583), and Babington's
<i>Exposition of the Commandments</i> (1583) contain vigorous
attacks on the stage as an institution and on all who
follow its fortunes. Distrust and jealousy were common
within the ranks of the actors and playwrights. So
Chettle does not know Marlowe and does not wish to know
him; Nash, though he defends Greene against Harvey,
expressly disclaims any intimacy; and we shall learn that
Greene was jealous of Marlowe during a large portion of
his period of dramatic authorship. But the playwrights
abominated the actors even more than they distrusted
each other. Frequently they refer to actors as
puppets and apes dressed up in another's feathers.
Greene, in <i>Never too Late</i>, calls the actor "Esop's crow,"
and in <i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i>, in the famous passage referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
to Shakespeare, he calls the actors "burrs,"
"puppets that speak from our mouths," and "antics
garnished in our colours." The author of <i>The Return
from Parnassus</i> (1602) calls them "mimic apes," and
Florio, in his preface to <i>Montaigne's Essays</i> (translated
1603) refers to actors as "base rascals, vagabond abjects,
and porterly hirelings." Though proud of their calling
as literary men the dramatists looked with shame on their
writing for the stage. Lodge, who in 1580 had defended
poetry and plays against Gosson, in <i>Scillæ's Metamorphosis</i>
of 1589 declared his determination "to write no
more of that whence shame doth grow." If Greene
refers to plays at all he calls them "vanities"; connects
their composition with the basest efforts of life, and
arraigns dependence on "so mean a stay." Even
Shakespeare "in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes"
beweeps alone his "outcast state" (Sonnet XXIX), and
exclaims "For I am shamed by that which I bring
forth" (Sonnet LXXII). Conditions like these are not
likely to bring the better social adjustments into play, or
to call into a profession those who value name and fame
supremely. Schelling<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> calls attention to the fact that
playwriting took a higher position at the beginning of the
seventeenth century than it had taken at the end of the
previous century, and compares Marlowe, Shakespeare,
Greene and Jonson, the sons of low life, with Beaumont,
Fletcher, Chapman, Middleton and Marston, the sons of
gentlemen. By the time the sons of gentlemen were
ready to take to playwriting the path had been made ready
for them by their predecessors. Society of the times in
which Greene lived was not ready to treat either a playwright
or an actor as a good citizen. And a son of a nobleman,
entering the ranks of the pioneers, would have given
his life as a sacrifice just as did Marlowe and Greene.
Lodge was the son of a Lord Mayor, Peele's father was
a man of some education, and Lyly had influential connections
at court; yet the only man of the entire school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
of "university wits" who escaped a life of misery and a
death of want was Lodge, and he in 1596 deserted literature
for medicine. We cannot consider Greene's
"memory a blot"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on a time that is truly represented
as well by the tragical as the heroic outlines of his
character and history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sources of our knowledge and deduction concerning
Greene's life are of four classes&mdash;records, autobiographical
pamphlets and allusions, contemporary references,
legends. To the indubitable records belong the
university registers, the stationers' registers, and the title
pages to his printed books. From the first we learn that
Greene was entered as a sizar at St John's College,
Cambridge, 26th November 1575, that he was admitted to
the degree of B.A. some time in 1578, that he proceeded
to the degree of M.A., after residence at Clare Hall, Cambridge,
in 1583; from the second we learn that his first
book was the first part of <i>Mamillia</i>, entered for publication
3rd October 1580, though not published until 1583,
and other facts concerning the time of publication of his
successive books and plays; from the signature to the
<i>Maiden's Dream</i>, "R. Greene, <i>Nordericensis</i>," and to the
address to Lodge's <i>Euphues Shadow</i>, "Robert Greene
<i>Norfolciensis</i>," we learn that Greene was born in Norfolk.
Of a lower order of certainty as to their application to
Greene, yet still satisfying the closest scrutiny, is the
record in the parish register of St Leonard's, Shoreditch,
of the burial of Greene's illegitimate child, Fortunatus
Greene, 12th August 1593; and the record in the
register of St George, Tombland, uncovered and interpreted
by Collins, indicating that the dramatist himself
was the second child of Robert Greene, a saddler, and
Jane his wife, and was baptised the 11th of July 1558.</p>

<p>To the second class of biographical materials belong
Greene's own prose works, the <i>Mourning Garment, Never</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
<i>too Late</i>, with the second part, <i>Francesco's Fortunes</i>,
the <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i>, all partly autobiographical;
and <i>The Repentance of Robert Greene</i>, confessedly autobiographical,
but, until lately, of questioned authenticity.
The biographical material in these works is ample,
but its value is discounted by certain considerations
involved in the motives of Greene's pamphlet composition.
When Greene began to write, art was not yet
strong enough to command a popular hearing without
the assistance of a didactive motive. Adapting himself
to the conditions with a tact that made him the most
broadly read writer of his time, Greene made edification
the end of his writing from the first. His second work
to be entered on the Stationers' Register, March 1581,
had a distinct moral purpose: "Youth, seeing all his ways
so troublesome, abandoning virtue and leaning to vice,
recalleth his former follies with an inward repentance."
In choosing topics for popular pamphlets Greene tells
such a story as that derived from Ælian in <i>Planetomachia</i>
(1585), or he tells over the story of the prodigal son as in
the <i>Mourning Garment</i>. And throughout his life moral
purpose remained a factor in his prose and drama. He
turned from romances to the composition of the conny-catching
pamphlets, in the trust "that those discourses
will do great good, and be very beneficial to the commonwealth
of England." <i>A Looking-Glass for London and
England</i> is a pure moral interlude. Often he moralises
when it is unnecessary to do so, or when he has to change
his original to introduce a didactic motive. Even the
Palmer who tells the tale of <i>Never too Late</i> is himself
penitent for his past sins. In <i>Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay</i> the jolly friar of Brazen-nose is made at the end to
surrender his calling through motives of remorse as far as
possible from the spirit of his life, and <i>James IV.</i> ends
with a penitent sovereign begging forgiveness for his sins.
These facts show, if they show anything, that the motive
of repentance was a conventional thing with Greene, and
that however faithful it may have been to his own experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
not the least advantage in its use lay in its
popularity. That it was a popular motive is shown by
the vogue of such books as Tarlton's <i>News out of Purgatory</i>
(1590), and by the fact that T. Newman, in a dedication
to <i>Greene's Vision</i> (1592), asserts that "many have
published repentances in his name." That much of
Greene's autobiographical material is veracious we have
corroborative evidence to prove; we should, however,
not be justified in accepting it all without question.
There is a bland shamelessness in the confession of sins
that is itself one of the best signs of health. When
Greene says, "I saw and practised such villainy as is
abominable to declare," he is expressing in phrase
strikingly similar to Hamlet's words to Ophelia, "I am
myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of
such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me," a characteristic moral attitude of the times.</p>

<p>What do we learn from the romances concerning
Greene's life? The <i>Mourning Garment</i> is a modernised
version of the prodigal son story, and its relation to
Greene's own history may be slight or even factitious.
The story of <i>Never too Late</i> touches Greene more closely.
In this there is recounted the fortunes of "a gentleman of
an ancient house, called Francesco; a man whose parentage
though it were worshipful, yet it was not indued
with much wealth; insomuch that his learning was
better than his revenues, and his wit more beneficial
than his substance." This Francesco, "casting his eye
on a gentleman's daughter that dwelt not far from
Caerbranck," named Isabel, fell in love with her, and
married her against the opposition of Fregoso, her father.
For five years "they laboured to maintain their loves,
being as busy as bees, and as true as turtles, as desirous
to satisfy the world with their desert as to feed the
humours of their own desires." At the end of this time
they were reconciled with Fregoso, and "they counted
this smile of fortune able to countervail all the contrary
storms that the adverse planets had inflicted upon them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Now after two years "it so chanced that Francesco had
necessary business to dispatch certain his urgent affairs
at the chief city of that island, called Troynovant:
thither, with leave of his father, and farewell to his wife,
he departed after they were married seven years." In
the city he surrendered to the lures of a courtesan,
Infida, and "seated in her beauty, he lived a long while,
forgetting his return to Caerbranck." For three years
the two lovers "securely slumbered in the sweetness of
their pleasures," ignoring the womanly complaints of
Isabel and neglectful of the passage of time. Then finding
that "all his corn was on the floor, that his sheep were
dipt, and the wool sold," Infida turned him out of doors.
Francesco laments his hard fortune in an invective
against courtesans that stings with the passion of the
author's personal feeling. In his "perplexity he passed
over three or four days till his purse was clean empty"
and he was compelled "to carry his apparel to the brokers,
and with great loss to make money to pay for his diet."
"In this humour he fell in amongst a company of players,
who persuaded him to try his wit in writing of comedies,
tragedies, or pastorals, and if he could perform anything
worth the stage, then they would largely reward him for
his pains. Francesco, glad of this motion, seeing a means
to mitigate the extremity of his want, thought it no dishonour
to make gain of his wit or to get profit by his
pen: and therefore, getting him home to his chamber,
writ a comedy; which so generally pleased all the audience
that happy were those actors in short time that could
get any of his works, he grew so exquisite in that faculty."
The remainder of the story relates Isabel's repulse of the
seductions of an admirer, Infida's unsuccessful efforts
at reconciliation with the now prosperous Francesco, and
the latter's penitent return to his faithful wife.</p>

<p>The story told in <i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i> quite closely
resembles that of <i>Never too Late</i> and is clearly autobiographical.
To this fact Greene bears witness when,
near the end of the story, he writes: "Here, gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
break I off Roberto's speech, whose life in most part
agreeing with mine, found one self punishment as I have
done. Hereafter suppose me the said Roberto, and I
will go on with that he promised." In this story, "an
old new-made gentleman" named Gorinius, living in
an island city "made rich by merchandise, and populous
by long space," had two sons, the one a scholar, named
Roberto, married and but little regarded, the other named
Lucanio, the heir-apparent of his father's ill-gathered
goods. On his death-bed Gorinius bequeathed his entire
property to Lucanio: "only I reserve for Roberto, thy
well-read brother, an old groat (being the stock I first
began with), wherewith I wish him to buy a groatsworth
of wit." Upon the death of Gorinius, and the
distribution of the property according to will, Roberto
"grew into an inward contempt of his father's unequal
legacy, and determinate resolution to work Lucanio all
possible injury." As Lucanio "was of a condition
simple, shamefast, and flexible to any counsel," Roberto
seemed on a fair way to success, until Lamilia, a courtesan
with whom he had plotted for Lucanio's undoing, repudiated
the understanding and informed the heir of the
plot against his gold. Forbidden the house, "Roberto,
in an extreme ecstasy, rent his hair, curst his destiny,
blamed his treachery, but most of all exclaimed against
Lamilia, and in her against all enticing courtesans." ...
"With this he laid his head on his hand, and leant his
elbow on the ground, sighing out sadly, 'Heu patior telis
vulnera facta meis!'" Roberto's lamentations were overheard
by one sitting on the other side of the hedge, who,
getting over, offered such comfort as his ability would
yield, doing so "the rather," as he said, "for that I
suppose you are a scholar, and pity it is men of learning
should live in lack." Greatly wondering Roberto asked
how he might be employed. "'Why, easily,' quoth he,
'and greatly to your benefit; for men of my profession
get by scholars their whole living.' 'What is your
profession?' said Roberto. 'Truly, sir,' said he, 'I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
am a player.' 'A player!' quoth Roberto; 'I took you
rather for a gentleman of great living; for if by outward
habit men should be censured, I tell you, you would be
taken for a substantial man.' 'So am I where I dwell,'
quoth the player, 'reputed able at my proper cost to
build a windmill.'" Roberto now again asked how he
was to be used. "'Why, sir, in making plays,' said the
other; 'for which you shall be well paid, if you will take
the pains.' Roberto, perceiving no remedy, thought
it best to respect his present necessity, (and), to try his
wit, went with him willingly." As Roberto's fortunes
improved Lucanio's drooped, until finally "Roberto
hearing of his brother's beggary, albeit he had little
remorse of his miserable state, yet did he seek him out,
to use him as a property; whereby Lucanio was somewhat
provided for." The character and miserable end of
Roberto as a result of the profession he had assumed
may be given in Greene's own words: "For now when the
number of deceits caused Roberto to be hateful almost
to all men, his immeasurable drinking had made him the
perfect image of the dropsy, and the loathsome scourge
of lust tyrannised in his bones. Living in extreme
poverty, and having nothing to pay but chalk, which
now his host accepted not for current, this miserable
man lay comfortlessly languishing, having but one groat
left (the just proportion of his father's legacy), which
looking on, he cried, 'O, now it is too late, too late to
buy wit with thee; and therefore will I see if I can sell
to careless youth what I negligently forgot to buy.'"</p>

<p>To a somewhat different class of testimony belongs
<i>The Repentance of Robert Greene</i>, probably an authentic
exemplar of that very popular class of deathbed
repentance that was multiplied by other hands after
Greene's death. Little can be found in this work but
admonitions to a higher life and caveats against lust.
Such details as are given are presented with no chronology.
Of his early life Greene tells us that "being at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
University of Cambridge, I light amongst wags as lewd
as myself, with whom I consumed the flower of my
youth; who drew me to travel into Italy and Spain,
in which places I saw and practised such villainy as is
abominable to declare.... At my return into England,
I ruffled out in my silks, in the habit of malcontent,
and seemed so discontent that no place would please
me to abide in, nor no vocation cause me to stay myself
in: but after I had by degrees proceeded Master of Arts,
I left the university and away to London; where (after
I had continued some short time, and driven myself out
of credit with sundry of my friends) I became an author
of plays, and a penner of love-pamphlets, so that I soon
grew famous in that quality, that who for that trade
grown so ordinary about London as Robin Greene?"
Once, Greene tells us, he felt a terror of God's judgment.
This followed a lecture by a "godly learned man" in
St Andrew's Church in the city of Norwich. But when
his companions fell upon him, in a jesting manner
calling him Puritan and precisian, and wished he might
have a pulpit, what he had learned went quite out of his
remembrance. "Soon after I married a gentleman's
daughter of good account, with whom I lived for a
while; but ... after I had a child by her, I cast her
off, having spent up the marriage money which I had
obtained by her.</p>

<p>"Then left I her at six or seven, who went into Lincolnshire,
and I to London; where in short space I fell
into favour with such as were of honourable and good
calling." But though he knew how to get a friend he
"had not the gift or reason how to keep a friend."
Further he tells us that he had wholly betaken himself
to the planning of plays, that "these vanities and other
trifling pamphlets I penned of love and vain fantasies
was my chiefest stay of living," and that he had refrained
his wife's company for six years.</p>

<p>What may be the value of the third class of biographical
material, that derived from contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
references, is, perhaps, best revealed by reviewing the
history of the controversy with Gabriel Harvey. In 1590
Richard Harvey, the second of three brothers, attacked
all poets and writers, and Lyly and Nash particularly,
in a pamphlet entitled <i>The Lamb of God</i>, terming them
"piperly make-plays and make-bates," and comparing
them with Martin. Though not himself attacked,
Greene, because "he writ more than four others,"
retorted in defence of his brother dramatists in <i>A Quip
for an Upstart Courtier</i> (1592), making a satirical thrust
at the Harveys as the sons of a rope-maker. At the
request of Greene's physician the most offensive lines
were expunged from all except possibly the first edition.
But the harm had been done. Greene died before the
Harveys could or would make answer. Then, in Gabriel
Harvey's <i>Four Letters</i> (1592), the memory of Greene was
attacked in one of the most venomous pamphlets known
to the literature of vilification. Harvey's four epistles
were followed by Nash's <i>Strange News</i>, and other
controversial pamphlets, in which Nash attempts,
rather light-heartedly, to defend Greene's memory.
Other writers who take occasion to speak a good word
for Greene, after his death, are Chettle in <i>A Kind
Hart's Dream</i> (1593), a certain R. B., author of <i>Greene's
Funerals</i> (1594), and Meres in <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598).
Strange as it may seem it is impossible to decide that
Harvey seriously wronged Greene in his accounts of fact.
Like Greene, Harvey has been too much abused on
account of his unfortunate quarrels with men whom
history was to discover were his superiors. His pedantry,
his egotism, and the very virulence of his hatred seem to
nullify the effect of his assault, without greatly militating
against the truth of the account he gives. Nash, who is
vigorous in his expressions of respect for his friend, is
notably weak in his rebuttals of fact. With the exception
of some manifest exaggerations, Harvey's account of
Greene's death-bed, of his association with Cutting Ball
and his sister, and of his son Fortunatus, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
accepted as substantially a true one. Harvey's account
will not be given here but it is epitomised when "we come
to finish up his life."</p>

<p>There remain for consideration, and in most part for
dismissal, a few traditions that have grown up about the
name of Greene. Early biographers, among whom was
Dyce, attempted to show that Greene had at one time
been a minister. This opinion was partly based upon
the two manuscript notes on a copy of <i>George-a-Greene</i>:
"Written by ... a minister who acted the piner's pt in it
himselfe. Teste W. Shakespeare," and "Ed. Juby saith
that ye play was made by Ro. Greene." Aside from the fact
that these notes are not shown to have any authority, and
may, in fact, contradict each other, the probabilities are
all against the hypothesis that Greene was ever a minister.
Nowhere in his singularly open personal revelations does
he suggest that he ever acted as such. Indeed, his expressions
are inconsistent with such an idea. "In all
my life I never did any good," he writes in his <i>Repentance</i>,
and in the same tract he tells of that incipient conversion
that was nipped in the bud by the ridicule of his
fellows. Surely this account does not sound like the
confession of an ex-minister, and these same copesmates
would certainly not have maintained silence had they
known that Greene had held a living. Considerations of
time make it impossible that Greene should have been
the Robert Greene who, in 1576, was one of the Queen's
chaplains, for at this time he could not have been more
than eighteen years old; nor is it at all likely that he is
the Greene who, in 1584-5, was vicar of Tollesbury in
Essex, for in these years he was engaged in the unclerical
exercise of preparing for printing <i>The Mirror of Modesty,
Morando The Tritameron of Love, The Card of Fancy,</i> and
<i>Planetomachia</i>. The theory that Greene was an actor
is traced back to the manuscript notes already quoted,
and to some ambiguous remarks by Harvey in his <i>Four
Letters</i>. Fleay's ingenious conjecture that Greene is
identical with that Rupert Persten who accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
Leicester's company to Saxony and Denmark in 1585-87,
and that this name is equivalent to "Robert the Parson,"
is discredited on philological grounds as well as for its
general lack of weight. That Greene may have now and
then assumed a part upon the stage is quite possible; but
that he never associated himself with the actor's calling is
made quite clear from his contemptuous treatment of
actors in the passages already quoted. It is perhaps not
entirely necessary to dismiss the theory, based on the
entry on the title-page of <i>Planetomachia</i>, "By Robert
Greene, Master of Arts and student in physic," that
Greene had intended to study medicine, and was hindered
from pursuing his purpose by his success in literature.
It is likely, however, that Greene here uses the term
"physic" in the sense of "natural philosophy," as it
was used by Chaucer and Gower, and that he had particular
desire to defend his ability to treat an astronomical
topic such as that of <i>Planetomachia</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have, in a disjointed manner, no doubt, presented
Greene's life under the heads of the sources from which
our information is gained, rather than in regular chronological
sequence, in order that due discrimination may be
used in constructing the finished scheme of his life's
activities. To the imaginative reader there is material
enough and to spare, but to the exact scientist there is a
bare modicum. Without rash assumptions it seems safe
to imagine that Greene's father, like Rabbi Bilessi and
Gorinius, was well-to-do; that with the exception of the
duration of his domestic life, Greene's married life is
substantially represented by the story of Isabel and
Francesco; that as a playwright Greene experienced the
vicissitudes suggested in <i>Never too Late</i> and <i>A Groatsworth
of Wit</i>; and that his death is substantially represented
by Harvey in <i>Four Letters</i>. Attempting a bare
outline of Greene's life one would feel safe in assuming
that he was born not earlier than 1558; that he took his
bachelor's degree at St John's College, Cambridge, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
1578; thereafter toured the continent, probably after the
3rd of October 1580, at which date the first part of
<i>Mamillia</i> was registered; that returning he took his M.A.
at Clare Hall in 1583, and immediately began the composition
of love pamphlets and comedies, the latter being
now lost; that he married not later than 1585, lived with
his wife until after the birth of a child, in 1586 deserted
her, and went to London never to return. There
undertaking the composition of serious plays, the first
extant play is produced in 1587 or 1588, he is incorporated
Master of Arts at Oxford in July 1588, and continues
"that high and loose course of living which poets generally
follow" (Anthony Wood), writing love pamphlets
until about 1590, and then, in obedience to a promise
repeatedly made by himself, pressing forward the exposure
of the devices used by cozeners and conny-catchers,
until his untimely death on 3rd September 1592.</p>

<p>During the last twelve years of a short but varied and
active life Greene was more or less prominently before
the public eye. For much of this time he was easily the
most widely read of English writers. His literary
activities were scattered over a broad range of topics and
styles. In his work there are represented the wit, the
romance, the bombast, the Euphuism, the Arcadianism,
and no less the new naturalism of his time. He expressed
himself in novellas, in pamphlets, in controversial broadsides,
in comedies, in serious plays, and in Italianate
verse. He was in fact the first <i>litterateur</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
and his prose fiction represents what Herford has called
"for English-speaking contemporaries the most considerable
body of English narrative which the language yet
contained." Twenty-seven romances and prose tracts
were published during Greene's lifetime, excluding <i>The
Defence of Conny-catching</i>, which cannot with certainty be
ascribed to him; and nine tracts and plays, including the
doubtful <i>George-a-Greene</i>, were published after his death.</p>

<p>Aside from Greene's remarkable versatility and rapidity
of workmanship,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his most striking characteristic as an
author is his ability immediately to adapt himself to the
changing literary demands of the hour. This will be seen
to have particular significance in connection with the
question of the chronology of his plays, yet it is pertinent
here as pointing the dividing line between his earlier and
later interests in composition. At the end of <i>Never too
Late</i> (1590) Greene says, "And therefore as soon as may
be, gentlemen, look for Francesco's further fortunes,
and after that my <i>Farewell to Folly</i>, and then adieu to all
amorous pamphlets." And in the dedication of <i>Francesco's
Fortunes</i> (Part II. of <i>Never too Late</i>) he advised
his gentlemen readers to look for "more deeper matters."
So also at the end of his <i>Mourning Garment</i> (1590)
Greene announces that he will write no more love
pamphlets. This work must serve as the first-fruits of
his new labours and the last farewell to his fond desires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
Again, in the dedicatory epistle to <i>Farewell to Folly</i>,
licensed in 1587 but not published until 1591, about which
time it is reasonable to suppose the epistle was written,
he says this is "the last I mean ever to publish of such
superficial labours." That he is sincere in this promise is
clear from the fact that, while he published <i>Philomela</i> in
1592, he is careful in doing so to explain that it had been
hatched long ago and was now given his name at the
solicitation of his printer. We have here fixed a point
about the year 1590 for the beginning of new and more
serious work. Two theories have been advanced to
explain the nature of this work. The one theory, which
has among its adherents Collins, the latest editor of
Greene's complete plays, supposes that Greene must refer
to the beginning of his play-writing. Against this
theory there are the strong objections that Greene must
have written plays before he made any promise to engage
in more serious writing, the strong circumstantial and
internal evidence that several of the extant plays ante-date
such a promise, and the no less significant fact that
Greene had no pride in his work as a playwright and no
respect for the calling as a serious occupation. The second
theory is that Greene had long contemplated the exposure
of the arts and devices of the under-world of prey, and that
the year 1590 represents approximately the time at which
he ceased the composition of romantic and mythologising
pamphlets, which associated him with Lyly and
Sidney and the more affected of the university writers,
and began the composition of realistic studies in the rogue
society of his own time. There is no reason to suppose
that Greene was not sincere in his desire to present
an edifying picture of the dangers surrounding London
youth and the weaknesses and vanities in English society.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>The first pamphlet, <i>A Notable Discovery of Cosenage</i>,
was printed in 1591, and was "written for the general
benefit of all gentlemen, citizens, apprentices, country
farmers and yeomen." Thereafter followed <i>The Second
Part of Conny-catching, The Third and Last Part of Conny-catching,
A Disputation Between a He Conny-catcher
and a She Conny-catcher,</i> and others of the same type,
of equal or less authenticity. All of these are very
far from the old romance in content, in method and in
language; Greene is now bold, slashing and fearless, and
wields something of the scorpion whip of Nash in his
taunting cruelty of assault. Changing his attitude he
now stands very near his subject; he writes from among
the society he castigates. There is some unusual significance
in this new attitude of Greene's, particularly
for drama. We shall find, it is believed, the same distinction
between Greene's earlier and later plays, not as
clearly marked as the change in prose, but definite enough
to establish within the dramatic work of Greene a line of
cleavage separating the mythology-loaded language and
unnatural incident of the <i>Tamburlaine</i> and <i>Spanish
Tragedy</i> type of play from the plays of simple poetry and
homely rural atmosphere that were to prepare the way for
the domestic drama of Heywood and Dekker and Munday
and Chettle, and to have a real influence on the dramaturgy
of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Upon the question of the chronology of Greene's plays
no editor can afford to be dogmatic. Yet so carefully
have the varied spiritual forces of Greene's life been
studied in connection with the manifest literary influences
of his time, and so painstaking have been the
deductions from those facts with which we are provided,
that one feels safe in laying down, upon the researches
of such scholars as Dyce, Fleay, Storojenko, Gayley and
Collins,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> an almost certain scheme of succession and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
chronology of Greene's extant dramas. A point of departure
is provided by the theory of Collins, often
vigorously insisted upon, that Greene did not begin to
write plays until about 1590. In this belief Collins is
joined by C. H. Hart,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who adduces the passage from
Greene's <i>Farewell to Folly</i>, quoted two pages above, as
a reason for thinking Greene took up playwriting near
the end of his life. Against any such theory there are
strong specific as well as important general objections.
It would require that all of Greene's plays, in addition
to half a dozen pamphlets, should have been written
between the opening of 1591 and the time of Greene's
death in 1592. In <i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i> Greene all but
certainly refers to himself as an "arch play-making
poet," and in <i>The Repentance of Robert Greene</i> he says,
"I became an author of plays and a penner of love
pamphlets." Certainly that total dissolution that follows
the practices of his calling could not have taken place in
two years, nor would one who thus joins the composition
of plays and poems have waited until ten years after the
licensing of his first tract in 1580 to write his first play.
If <i>Never too Late</i> and <i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i> have any
autobiographical value whatever those portions that
treat of playwriting experience are worthy the most
credence, and the theory that Greene should have
taken up playwriting late is quite inconsistent with the
purport of both of them.</p>

<p>But aside from any such considerations as these, there
are certain general principles having to do with the
customs of literary composition of the time, and particularly
of the group in which Greene moved, that make it
quite improbable that Greene should have waited until
1590 before beginning to write plays. Nothing is clearer
than that the movements of these pre-Shakespearean
groups were not movements of the individual but of
the mass. There is in the work of this era the utmost
possible play and interplay of influence. Marlowe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
the only strikingly originative writer of the times, yet the
facets of his contact with the literary life of England and
the Continent have by no means as yet been numbered.
Any new style of composition immediately assumed the
dignity of a school. Lyly's style became so popular
that Euphuism became a convention. So the appearance
of the <i>Arcadia</i>, of <i>Tamburlaine</i>, of a romance by
Greene, was followed by a flood of imitative works.
Greene's <i>Tully's Love</i> is used in <i>Every Woman in Her
Humour</i>, a comedy of humours after the model of
Jonson; the author of <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i> borrows from
<i>The Pinner of Wakefield</i> the swallowing of the seals;
Harvey accuses Nash of being "the ape of Greene,"
and Greene of being the "ape of Euphues"; <i>Tamburlaine</i>
is imitated again and again, sometimes in whole, as in
<i>Alphonsus of Arragon, Selimus,</i> and <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>,
but more often through the unconscious influence of
its affected language and dramatic types. As much can
be said of the imitation of Kyd's <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>.
Traces of the same source-book appear in Greene's
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> and Marlowe's <i>Dr
Faustus</i>, and identical lines appear in Greene's <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> and Peele's <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>. The same comedy
appears in <i>A Looking-Glass for London and England</i>,
<i>Locrine</i> and <i>Selimus</i>, and <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i>
contains lines from <i>Tamburlaine</i> and <i>Dr Faustus</i>.
Shakespeare borrows from Greene, Oberon for <i>A
Midsummer Night's Dream</i>; features of the story of
<i>Euphues, his Censure to Philautus</i> for <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>; features of <i>Farewell to Folly</i> for <i>Much Ado
About Nothing</i>; characters from the <i>Mourning Garment</i>
for Polonius and Laertes, and innumerable reminiscent
lines. Sometimes the influence is more complicate still.
Greene in <i>Pandosto</i> borrows from Lyly's <i>Campaspe</i>, and
Shakespeare, borrowing from Greene for his <i>Winter's
Tale</i>, approximates Lyly's form; and Greene, ridiculing
Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i>, makes some allusions that
indicate that he as well as Marlowe must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
acquainted with Primaudaye. Cases of this kind are
so frequent that they seem to have no individual bearing,
but to refer to the general conditions of art composition
of the day. In such a system of community of ideas
Greene was entirely at home. Of this we have abundant
evidence in his often displayed ability to feel the popular
pulse, and to make himself a part of every growing
movement. His first works were written under the
influence of the Italian school. In these early works
there is a strong strain of Euphuism, which is made explicit
in his <i>Euphues, his Censure to Philautus</i> (1587).
Two years later a new style had arisen through the
composition of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> (published in 1590),
and Greene aligns himself with the new pastoral movement
in his <i>Menaphon</i>. Not content with the tacit
desertion of the conceits of Lyly he gives his new work
the sub-title <i>Camilla's Alarum to Slumbering Euphues</i>,
and attacks his old models for artificiality. So also
Greene is quick to utilise contemporary events to add to
the popular appeal of his writings. From the publication
of the <i>Spanish Masquerado</i> (1589), celebrating the
victory over the <i>Spanish Armada</i>, there is every reason
to believe Greene received his warmest recognition at
court; and sincere as were his conny-catching pamphlets
we may be sure that their value was not lessened in
Greene's eyes by their popular appeal. Greene was
neither more nor less of an imitator than his fellows; his
ideals and methods of composition were, no doubt, those
of his time, and if we cannot claim for him that he
consistently broke ground in new domains of expression,
we may at any rate be certain that he did not
fall far behind in the progressive motion of the art of
his era.</p>

<p>The significance of these things in the study of the
chronology of Greene's plays should be manifest. There
were during Greene's literary life three extraordinary
dramatic successes on the London stage&mdash;<i>Tamburlaine,
Dr Faustus</i> and <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>. It is reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
to suppose that the man who, in prose composition,
always struck when the iron was hot, would, as a playwright,
use the same expedition to take advantage of a
popular wave of enthusiasm. That Greene's <i>Alphonsus
of Arragon</i> was written under the inspiration of Marlowe's
<i>Tamburlaine</i>, and that <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>
was written as a reflex from <i>Dr Faustus</i> is so certain as to
require no demonstration. And it is only less certain
that we have in <i>Orlando Furioso</i> a reminiscence of
<i>Tamburlaine</i> and of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, and that
<i>James IV.</i> was inspired as a pseudo-historical play by
the growing popularity of the chronicle type. According
to the best authority obtainable <i>Tamburlaine</i> appeared
in 1587, <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> before 1587, and <i>Dr Faustus</i>
in 1588. With these conditions before us, and in the
light of Greene's known character and the habits of the
times, it is scarcely possible to think that Greene should
have waited until <i>Dr Faustus</i> had somewhat dimmed
the lustre of <i>Tamburlaine</i> before imitating the latter;
or that he should have ignored the undoubted vigour of
the magician motive to imitate a form that had enjoyed
prior popularity, only to take up for treatment a drama
in the occult spirit, when this type in its turn had
been laid on the shelf in favour of the newer form of
chronicle play. Ignoring then for the present <i>A
Looking-Glass for London and England</i>, which is not
entirely Greene's own composition, and <i>George-a-Greene</i>,
concerning which doubts must exist, we are provided
with the order of succession of the four remaining plays
in the order of publication of their prototypes:
<i>Alphonsus of Arragon, Orlando Furioso, Friar Bacon
and Friar Bungay, James IV.</i> Further investigation
provides more explicit chronological data.</p>

<p><i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i> is the earliest of Greene's extant
plays. Its date has been set at 1587 or 1588 by Gayley,
who has carefully worked over the conclusions of Fleay,
Storojenko and others. That Greene had been interested
in Alphonsus as early as 1584 is clear from his mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
of the name in the dedication to <i>The Card of Fancy</i>.
The play was not written before <i>Tamburlaine</i>, for that
hero is mentioned in it; on the other hand there are
several considerations that seem to show that it was
written soon after <i>Tamburlaine</i> in an effort to share
some of that play's popularity. Greene's words in the
prologue:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Will now begin to treat of bloody Mars,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of doughty deeds and valiant victories."</span><br />
</p>

<p>seem to announce a purpose to begin a new warlike vein.
The play resembles <i>Tamburlaine</i> in bombast, in rant,
in comparing a victorious warrior with the gods, in the
motive of Asiatic and Mohammedan conquest, and in
its double original design. Unlike <i>Tamburlaine</i> only one
of the parts was completed. There is a possibility that
the two plays are mentioned in conjunction by Peele
in his well-known "Farewell" verses to Sir John Norris
and his companions (1589):</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Bid theatres and proud tragedians,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bid Mahomet's Poo and mighty Tamburlaine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">King Charlemayne, Tom Stukeley and the rest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Adieu."</span><br />
</p>

<p>By the ingenuity of Mr Fleay we are able to conjecture
that "Mahomet's Poo" probably refers to the brazen
head, or poll, through which the Prophet speaks in the
fourth act of the play.</p>

<p>That Alphonsus was not successful on the stage seems
likely when one compares the play with the successful
productions of the day. Its failure is indicated by the
fact that, though a second part was promised in the
epilogue, no such part is known to have been written.
More interesting still, for the light it throws on the
fortunes of this play, and on Greene's relationship with
his contemporaries, is the study of the antagonism that
suddenly appears in all of Greene's allusions to Marlowe.
This feeling apparently dates from the beginning of 1588,
or about the time of the probable first performance of
<i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i>. It is first marked in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
satirical allusion to <i>Tamburlaine</i> contained in the address
to the gentleman readers prefixed to <i>Perimedes</i> (1588).
In this the author expresses a purpose to "keep my
old course to palter up something in prose using mine
old poesie still <i>Omne tulit punctum</i>, although lately two
Gentlemen Poets made two madmen of Rome beat it
out of their paper bucklers, and had it in derision for
that I could not make my verses jet upon the stage in
tragical buskins, every word filling the mouth like the
faburden of Bo-Bell, daring God out of heaven with that
Atheist Tamburlaine or blaspheming with the mad
priest of the sun." He ends this passage as follows:
"If I speak darkly, gentlemen, and offend with this
digression, I crave pardon, in that I but answer in print
what they have offered on the stage." Just who the
two poets and two madmen of Rome may have been it is
now impossible to say. What stands out clear is that
Greene has been attacked on the stage for failing to make
his "verses jet upon the stage in tragical buskins,"
after the manner of Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i>; and as
Marlowe was the atheist, and not Tamburlaine, it is
also clear that Greene has a feeling of resentment against
his brother poet. The explanation that seems most
sensible is that Greene has attempted to write a play
in Marlowe's vein, has failed, and being publicly taunted
for his failure, either by Marlowe himself or by his partisans,
expresses his determination to continue writing
in prose, the form of composition that has already
brought him fame. Greene's animosity toward Marlowe
continued for several years. In Nash's address prefixed
to Greene's <i>Menaphon</i> (1589)<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the same feeling is
manifested, possibly at the instigation of Greene. Here
Nash, perhaps to throw contempt on Marlowe as a
writer of plays, vaunts Greene as a writer of romance.
<i>Menaphon</i>, he holds, excels the achievements of men who,
unable to write romance, "think to outbrave better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
pens with the swelling bombast of a bragging blank
verse." The same attack is persistently pushed in the
poem, also prefixed to <i>Menaphon</i>, by Thomas Barnaby
(signing himself by anagram Brabine), in the words "the
pomp of speech that strives to thunder from a stage man's
throat." Again and again Greene and his friends return
to the attack on Marlowe, now in <i>Francesco's Fortunes</i>,
in a slighting reference to the trade of Marlowe's father,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
now in <i>Greene's Vision</i>, and finally in <i>A Groatsworth of
Wit</i>, in which, though in more friendly guise, Greene
reproves Marlowe for his atheism.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There can be little
doubt that thus was displayed the rancour of the unsuccessful
as against the successful dramatist. The
play of <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i> is in fact quite unworthy
to be placed beside Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i> in any comparison
for literary excellence. Whether Greene recognised
this or not he was undoubtedly influenced in his
later play composition by the failure of his first effort.
Without immediately striking out in any new vein he
now proceeds to burlesque and to parody where first
he had imitated.</p>

<p>About 1585 there was produced Thomas Kyd's <i>The
Spanish Tragedy</i>, a tragedy of blood, of madness, and
revenge, with many ingredients of the Senecan plays.
This play and Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i> were the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
sensations of the English stage of the sixteenth century.
No single play of Shakespeare's can be said to have had
the instantaneous popular success and the immediate
and widespread imitation given to both of these plays.
In the next play that Greene wrote unaided after the
failure of his <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i> there is discernible
an entire change in the author's attitude. He is no more
originative than he was before, but he does not again
attempt to treat an imitative drama in the spirit of its
original. Certain of the scenes of <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i>
were ridiculous enough, but they were undertaken in no
apparent spirit of burlesque. In <i>Orlando Furioso</i> Greene
proceeds to parody the two most popular types holding
the boards in his day. The real hero of <i>Orlando Furioso</i>
is not the mad French knight, Orlando, but Sacripant.
And Sacripant is a foiled Tamburlaine, a high aspiring
king whose ambition comes to nothingness. In the spirit
of Macbeth, who himself had something of Tamburlaine's
lust of conquest, are the words of Sacripant: "I hold
these salutations as ominous; for saluting me by that
which I am not, he presageth what I shall be." And in
the musings of Sacripant there operates the spirit of
Tamburlaine. "Sweet are the thoughts that smother from
conceit," he reflects; his chair presents "a throne of
majesty"; his thoughts "dream on a diadem"; he
becomes "co-equal with the gods." The lines beginning
"Fair queen of love," spoken by Orlando (<a href="#Page_187">p. 187</a> of this
edition) remind us of the lofty yearning love of Tamburlaine
for Zenocrate. As a play <i>Orlando Furioso</i> is
<i>Tamburlaine</i> by perversions, and purposely so. Its chief
martial spirit strives for high ends by ignoble means.
He fails to win his mistress, and he fails to win his throne;
done out of both by a madman. If this play is a perversion
of the <i>Tamburlaine</i> motive, it is also a burlesque
on the tragedy of blood. There are indications
that Greene would have been quite willing to ridicule
Kyd. Nash, in the same preface to <i>Menaphon</i> in which
he had ridiculed Marlowe, satirises Kyd in the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
lines, "blood is a beggar," and "whole Hamlets, I should
say handfuls of tragical speeches." Kyd, as a non-university
man, represented that rising coterie, of which
Shakespeare was the master, against whom the jealous
shafts of the university wits were directed. The signs
of the influence of the tragedy of blood type are many.
In the balanced and parallel lines of Senecan character,
and found little elsewhere in Greene:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Only by me was lov'd Angelica,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Only for me must live Angelica."</span><br />
</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Angelica doth none but Medor love,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Angelica doth none but Medor love!";</span><br />
</p>

<p>in the allusions to Orestes, "Orestes was never so mad in
his life as you were"; in the symbols of a classic Hades,
Pluto and Averne; in the interspersed quotations from
Latin and Italian; in the vague continental setting; in
the use of a chorus; in the unheroic revenge motive; in
the burlesque death, and the tearing of limb from limb;
in "Orlando's sudden insanity and the ridiculously
inadequate occasion of it, the headlong <i>dénouement</i>, the
farcical technique, the mock heroic atmosphere, the
paradoxical absence of pathos, the absurdly felicitous
conclusion,&mdash;all seemingly unwitting,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> we have either
imitated or burlesqued the characteristics of the
popular revenge and blood play.</p>

<p>That <i>Orlando Furioso</i> was not written after 1591 is
clear from a passage in <i>A Defence of Conny-catching</i> (1592)
in which Greene is charged with selling the play twice,
once to the Queen's players for twenty nobles, and, when
these had gone to the provinces, to the Admiral's men for
as many more. As the Queen's players left the court
26th December 1591, the play must have existed before
that date. A reference to the Spanish Armada provides
30th July 1588 as a posterior limit. No valid conclusions
can be drawn from certain resemblances between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
lines in this play and lines in Peele's <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
on account of uncertainty as to the date of the latter
play. There seems no reason to doubt that Gayley is
right in pointing out 26th December 1588 as the date
of the first performance of the play before the Queen at
court.</p>

<p>About the time that Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i> appeared
there was presented, perhaps at the same play-house, the
Theatre, Marlowe's play, <i>Dr Faustus</i>. In this play
Marlowe treated with characteristic intensity the tragical
story of a magician who aspired for wisdom as <i>Tamburlaine</i>
had aspired for power. Magic and witchcraft
were popular in English literature. The story of <i>Dr
Faustus</i> was issued in German in 1587, and an English
translation was probably made about the same time.
The prose narrative of <i>The Famous History of Friar
Bacon</i> must also have been well known. Magic and
incantation had already been used by Greene in the
Brazen Head of <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i>, in Melissa of
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and in the priests of Rasni in <i>A
Looking-Glass for London and England</i>. But that
Marlowe was the first to see a large dramatic motive in
the conventional magic is certain. Here again we must
accept it that Marlowe was the leader and Greene the
adapter. We must agree with Collins that "the presumption
in favour of <i>Faustus</i> having preceded Greene's
play is so overwhelmingly strong that we cannot suppose
that Marlowe borrowed from Greene." But Greene's
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> is by no means an imitation
of <i>Dr Faustus</i>, nor is it a mere parody. Through his
new mastery of technique Greene was deriving a method
of his own that was to make him an effective and independent
story-teller. Also there was developing in his art
a refinement and sanity that revolted from the broadly-drawn
conceits and exaggerated passion of Marlowe's
early style. There is something suggestively ironical in
the opposition of the titles of the two plays, the <i>honourable</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
history of <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, as compared
with the <i>tragical</i> history of <i>Dr Faustus</i>. So also there
must be some delicate satire in the comic summoning of
Burden and the Hostess as opposed to the impressive
evocation of Alexander and Helen. And one of the
chief episodes in the play may have a jocose oblique reference
to <i>Dr Faustus</i>. "It is hardly too great an assumption,"
says Ward, "to regard Bacon's victory over
Vandermast as a cheery outdoing by genuine English
magic of the pretentious German article," represented in
the play of <i>Dr Faustus</i>. In <i>Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay</i> we have the first extant expression of Greene's
independent genius working along characteristic lines.
Though Marlowe provides him his starting-point, the
treatment is Greene's alone. While lacking in originativeness
this play reveals that clearly-marked individual
attitude toward art and the people of his brain that was
to give Greene's plays a pronounced influence in the development
of domestic comedy. And, according to
Henslowe's records, the play was as great a success as
<i>Dr Faustus</i> had been.</p>

<p>It seems likely that <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> appeared
the year following the production of <i>Dr Faustus</i>
in 1588. The year 1589 is also indicated by other evidence.
In theme the play resembles Greene's <i>Tully's Love</i>
of that year. In verse it is not unlike <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
which had appeared in 1588. A striking piece of collateral
evidence is adduced by Fleay, who, noting
Edward's remark in Act I., "Lacy, thou know'st next
Friday is Saint James'," is able to show that 1589 is the
only year between 1578 and 1595 in which St James's day
falls on Friday. Further confirmation of this date arises
from a satirical thrust by Greene at the now unknown
author of <i>Fair Em, the Miller's Daughter of Manchester</i>, in
his letter prefixed to <i>Farewell to Folly. Fair Em</i> bears
about the same relationship to <i>Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay</i> that this play bears to <i>Dr Faustus</i>. In other words,
while it is not exactly an imitation, it is in many respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
a reflection and a parody of the earlier play. The chief
points in which <i>Fair Em</i> parodies Greene's play are in the
title, in which the author, "somewhat affecting the
letter," plays upon Greene's "Fair Maid of Fressingfield";
in the relationship of a king with his courtier in the
courtship of a mistress, in Lubeck's fidelity to William
the Conqueror in the matter of his love for Mariana contrasted
with Lacy's treachery to Edward in courting
Margaret; in Em's scornful refusal to return to Mandeville
after he has discarded her contrasted with Margaret's
hasty forgiveness of Lacy after his unkind desertion; and
in the fact that, while in <i>Friar Bacon</i> Lacy is put into disguise
to pursue his love suits, in <i>Fair Em</i> it is the king who
masquerades to gain a mistress. Greene no more relished
the imitation of his work in 1591 than he did the following
year, when he wrote <i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i>. His
allusion to this play in his <i>Farewell to Folly</i> epistle is
identified by his quoting two lines that occur toward the
end of the play, "A man's conscience is a thousand
witnesses," and "Love covereth the multitude of sins."
Upon such sentiments in the drama Greene throws
ridicule in the following words: "O, 'tis a jolly matter
when a man hath a familiar style and can indite a whole
year and never be beholding to art! But to bring
Scripture to prove anything he says, and kill it dead with
the text in a trifling subject of love, I tell you is no small
piece of cunning." The most important point in these
lines is the indication that a year had been spent in the
composition of the play Greene was ridiculing. If we
are to accept it that <i>Fair Em</i> is in any respect an imitation
of <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> we must count at
least a year before the production of <i>Fair Em</i> to find
the date of Greene's play. Accepting early 1591 as
the point after which <i>Fair Em</i> could not have been
written,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <i>Friar Bacon</i> must have been produced at least
a year before that time, in 1589, or early in 1590.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
Supposing, on account of the beautiful eulogy to Elizabeth
at the close of the play, that it must have been
intended for presentation at court, Gayley suggests St
Stephen's day, 26th December 1589, as the probable date
of the play's production.</p>

<p>There is an element in the play of <i>Friar Bacon and
Friar Bungay</i> which, viewed in the light of the dramatic
influences of the times, reveals again Greene's quickness
of apprehension of a significant new strain in the drama.
It is the introduction of Prince Edward, the King of
England, and the Emperor of Germany, into the fabric of
his plot. This play must precede Marlowe's <i>Edward II.</i>
by several months, and at this point we are able finally
to dissociate Greene's genius from the direct influence of
his great contemporary. In order to develop this point
it may be well to glance hastily at the history of the
chronicle type of play in England to the time of Greene's
<i>James IV.</i> Plays on subjects drawn from English
history had been more or less common since the production
of <i>Gorboduc</i> in 1562. Three Latin plays, <i>Byrsa Basilica</i>
and the two college plays by Thomas Legge, <i>Richardus
Tertius</i>, had come somewhat near to the true
chronicle type. But it was not until the latter years of
the ninth decade of the century that dramatists began on
any large scale to utilise the history and mythology of
England's kings and wars for the celebrating of her contemporary
glories. Even before the Spanish Armada
England had become conscious of her own power and
eager for the display of her prowess. It was under the
stimulus of this growing consciousness of might that the
first true chronicle play, <i>The Famous Victories of Henry
the Fifth</i>, was written. In this play a dramatist for the
first time displays an adequate sense of the objective
value of the materials derived from history, combined
with that insight into human nature and largeness of
imaginative power that are necessary to make of the dry
records of Holinshed and Stow a moving dramatic story.
<i>The Life and Death of Jack Straw</i>, which also probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
preceded the Armada in its first production, is, while not
so good as <i>The Famous Victories</i>, a play of vigorous
characterisation and native English colouring of historical
events. But we are probably not far from the truth in
supposing that it was the year 1588 that brought the complete
development of the chronicle type. From this year
dates the production of the two parts of <i>The Troublesome
Reign of King John of England</i>, the date being indicated
by the allusion to <i>Tamburlaine</i> in the prologue. <i>The First
Part of the Contention betwixt two Famous Houses of York
and Lancaster</i>, etc., and <i>The True Tragedy of Richard,
Duke of York</i>, etc., upon which are based the second and
third parts of Shakespeare's <i>Henry VI.</i> trilogy, must be
dated little, if any, later. <i>The Troublesome Reign</i> is
known to have been performed by the Queen's men after
the other university men had left Greene alone as representative
of this company. The theory that connects
Greene's name with the composition is, however, so much
a matter of conjecture that nothing can be gained from
its consideration. Following these two works, almost
certainly not preceding them, as some have thought,
comes Marlowe's <i>Edward II.</i>, the faultless masterpiece of
his dramatic composition, produced probably in 1590.
And within a few years, in quick succession, there came
<i>Edward III., Richard II.</i>, and <i>Richard III.</i>, the <i>Henry
VI.</i> trilogy, and the culminating trilogy of the two parts
of <i>Henry IV.</i> and <i>Henry V.</i></p>

<p>Greene's <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, which appeared
in the midst of a movement toward the chronicle
type of play, so far adopted its formulas as to introduce
historic English characters into the fabric of a story
based on prose romance. No feature whatever of the
chronicle element as introduced into the play is found
in the source-book, nor is there any historical warrant
for any of the action presented under the names of the
kings. Greene's later attitude toward the rapidly-growing
chronicle type of play reveals the motives and
characteristics of his art at its maturity. He is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
willing to borrow from the dominant types of art holding
the stage at the time such expedients as shall serve to
adjust his work to the popular demand. But he no
longer transcends his own powers in an attempt at
imitation, or does violence to his own principles of
beauty in a parody of the work of a rival. His note is
now a clear and individual one, and to the day of
his death it sounds upon a definite key. Greene's
powers were no more equal to the blowing into pulsing
life of the dead bones of the chronicles of Stow and
Holinshed than they were efficient to answer in verse
to the lure of "impossible things" after the manner of
Marlowe. Greene may have expressed himself in a
chronicle play as did Marlowe in <i>Edward II.</i>, and as did
others of his time, but the simple fact is that no chronicle
play of unmixed type can with certainty be assigned
to him, and until a light is thrown that modifies somewhat
the view here outlined we must regard his part in
the composition of <i>The Troublesome Reign</i> and <i>The True
Tragedy</i> as distinctly a subordinate one. These considerations
are of some importance in considering <i>James
IV.</i> and <i>George-a-Greene</i>. Assuming that <i>George-a-Greene</i>
is Greene's work, it is clear that here he but
modified the chronicle play type to his own purposes,
and that he based his story, not on historical narrative,
but on the legends of the people as retained in ballad and
prose romance. Nor is <i>James IV.</i> based on historical
records. Going back to the source from which he drew
his early stories, he rests his plot on the first novel of the
third decade of Giraldi Cinthio's <i>Hecatommithi</i>. The
play's sole claim to be counted in the chronicle
group is based on the fact that certain of the imaginary
characters of Cinthio's fiction are provided with
the names of members of the English ruling family.
The events of the story have no connection with history,
and Greene's title, <i>The Scottish History of James the
Fourth, slain at Flodden</i>, is but an ingenious device
to reach with a romantic and misleading title the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
interest of an audience now newly turned toward historical
topics.</p>

<p>No evidence whatever can be adduced to show that
Greene was in any respect indebted to Marlowe's <i>Edward
II.</i> for his pseudo-chronicle on <i>James IV.</i> Present
information makes it seem probable that the plays were
performed about the same time, Marlowe's play being,
perhaps, a few months the earlier. The plays are quite
different. Each dramatist had attained to the maturity
of his powers through the purification of his artistic
ideals, but whereas Marlowe's last play is held to the
outlines of a rigorous art with an almost poignant reticence,
Greene's <i>James IV.</i> manifests the sweetening and
mellowing touch of a dignified and manly philosophy.
Nor can we see any indebtedness in Greene's play to
Peele's <i>Edward I.</i>, though the cruel abuse of the memory
of Queen Elinor contained in that play can get its only
justification on the theory that the play was written
immediately after the Spanish Armada, and therefore
two years before <i>James IV.</i> But there is one chronicle
play that Greene may have seen and that may have
influenced him slightly. It is not possible here to go
into the question of the authorship of <i>Edward III.</i> So
excellent is the play in its choicest passages that one
would not be loath to assign portions of it to Marlowe,
or to Shakespeare, or to impute the entire play to the
collaboration of these poets. One would even welcome
evidence that the hand of Greene is to be seen in the play.
Fleay assigns the play to Marlowe and sets its date of
production at 1590 or earlier, basing these suppositions
upon a citation from this play in a presumably satirical
allusion to Marlowe in Greene's <i>Never too Late</i>; perhaps
a strained double hypothesis, but one that has the
possibility of truth.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> One would tend to the theory that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
the play was written by Marlowe, on account of the total
absence of comedy and a dulcet sweetness in the blank
verse. If so it was an early study and must be placed
before <i>Edward II. Edward III.</i> is like <i>James IV.</i> in
the fact that it is not a pure chronicle play, but is based
for its most effective scenes upon a romantic episode
from Painter's <i>Palace of Pleasure.</i> As <i>James IV.</i> goes
back to a novella of Cinthio, the ultimate source of the
romantic by-plot of <i>Edward III.</i> is a novel by Bandello.
The historical portions of the play are based on Holinshed.
These romantic scenes, which comprise scene 2 of the
first act and the entirety of the second act, are strikingly
similar to the large theme of <i>James IV.</i> The love of
King Edward for the beautiful Countess of Salisbury,
whose castle he has rescued, is similar in its passion and
its ill-success to the love of James for Ida. Both stories
deal with Scottish wars, though in <i>Edward III.</i> the
romantic element arises as a result of the English king's
protection of his subject, the Countess of Salisbury,
against the Scots, whereas in <i>James IV.</i> the wars result
from the unfortunate love of the Scottish king for his
subject, Ida, and his consequent attempt to kill his
English wife, Dorothea. Like James, Edward is willing
to kill his queen in order to gain his love. The Countess
of Salisbury's lines,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"As easy may my intellectual soul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Be lent away, and yet my body live,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As lend my body, palace to my soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Away from her, and yet retain my soul,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>have something of Ida's incorruptible purity of principle
when she asks Ateukin "can his warrant keep my soul
from hell?" Ida's scorn of the man who would</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"be a king of men and worldly pelf</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet hath no power to rule and guide himself,"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>is like King Edward's&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Shall the large limit of fair Britanny</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By me be overthrown, and shall I not</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Master this little mansion of myself?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give me an armour of eternal steel!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I go to conquer kings; and shall I not then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Subdue myself?"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>In no pre-Shakespearean drama outside of Greene's
own work is the simple beauty of chaste womanhood
presented with the passion and sympathy that are to be
found in <i>Edward III.</i> Certainly Ida of <i>James IV.</i>, the
Countess of Salisbury of <i>Edward III.</i>, and Imogen of
Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i> are a trio of womanly beauty
and purity. In respect of poetry, the Countess of
Salisbury scenes of <i>Edward III.</i>, in spite of their somewhat
cloying sweetness, transcend any sustained passages
in Greene's works. Yet the poetry of <i>James IV.</i> is of
the same order. If Greene could but have prolonged his
vagrant notes of beauty he would have equalled the best
in this play. In respect of dramaturgy and human
psychology <i>James IV.</i> is far in advance of <i>Edward III.</i>
The simple and undeveloped story of love is in the hands
of the more skilled plotter of plays complicated to a fit
representation of the social implications of an act, and
the passion of Edward is in James developed to the
awful inward struggle of a sinning soul. In the absence
of facts as to the authorship of <i>Edward III.</i>, and as to
the date of its composition, it is impossible to draw
any conclusions as to influence or inter-relationship. It
is clear, however, that Greene's play is written in the
spirit of <i>Edward III.</i>, in that it is an adaptation of the
romantic motive that Greene knew so well how to
compass to the purposes of the popular chronicle play.</p>

<p><i>James IV.</i>, which is the last undoubted play of Greene's
composition, is also the best. Dramatically it is far in
advance of any other of his plays, and there is almost
no trace of the affected classical and mythological allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
that had marked his earlier writing. Considerations
of style and structure indicate that it was written soon
after <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>. Allusions to contemporary
events, such as Dorothea's mention of the Irish
uprisings, the idea of a union of England and Scotland,
that run through the play, and the brave words spoken
by Dorothea, who is not herself a maid, as a delicate
compliment to Elizabeth in her French wars,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Shall never Frenchman say an English maid</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of threats of foreign force will be afraid,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>indicate that the play was produced about 1590. Gayley
suggests that it was presented by Greene's company at
court on 26th December 1590, or as one of their five
performances in 1591. A pretty point is also made by
the same scholar based upon a resemblance between
lines in this play and certain lines of Peele's. Though
the matter is too confused to serve well as chronological
data it seems worthy of review if only for the reason
that slightly different results may be reached than those
indicated by Gayley. In the first scene of the first act
of <i>James IV.</i> Ida has the following lines:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And weel I wot, I heard a shepherd sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, like a bee, love hath a little sting."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Comparing this with lines in the fragment of Peele's
<i>The Hunting of Cupid</i>, preserved in a manuscript volume
of extracts by Drummond of Hawthornden, the conclusion
is reached that it is Peele, the writer of pastoral,
to whom Greene refers as "shepherd," and that Greene's
lines are a direct transcription from Peele. Referring
to the Stationers' Registers we learn that Peele's <i>The
Hunting of Cupid</i> was listed for 26th July 1591, certainly
later than we should be willing to place the beginning
of composition on Greene's <i>James IV.</i> The formal
proviso, "That if it be hurtful to any other copy before
licensed ... this to be void," may or may not indicate
the existence of an earlier copy. That the general
motive was in the air and had caught the ear of Greene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
is clear from the snatches and fragments of it we find
in his late work. In the <i>Mourning Garment,</i> registered
1590, are lines moving upon the same rhyme and answering
the same interrogation as Peele's verses:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Ah, what is love? It is a pretty thing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As sweet unto a shepherd as a king."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>One who gets this haunting strain in mind cannot fail
to notice how frequently Greene uses the rhyme of <i>thing,
bring, king,</i> and <i>sting</i> in <i>James IV.</i> Once it is:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Although a bee be but a little thing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You know, fair queen, it hath a bitter sting."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in the first scene of the second act Greene plays
upon the repetition of this rhyme. Peele himself again
uses the refrain in <i>Decensus Astræ</i>, licensed October
1591. The argument from the fact that "weel I wot"
in Ida's line seems to reflect the same clause in <i>The
Hunting of Cupid</i> would be stronger were it not that
"weel I wot" occurs only in the Drummond manuscript
and is not found in the fragment quoted by Dyce<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from
the Rawlinson manuscript. Here instead of "weel I
wot" is found "for sure." As Greene himself has used
the refrain in a song sung by a shepherd's wife it leaves
room to doubt that either the swains of <i>The Hunting</i> or
Peele himself was the shepherd. It is clear that the first
general use of the motive had occurred in Greene's
<i>Mourning Garment</i>. The positive objections to placing
<i>James IV.</i> subsequent to July 1591 lead one to one of
three conclusions: (1) Peele's lyric had long been written
before it was entered in the <i>Stationers' Registers</i>, and in
manuscript form inspired the strains in the <i>Mourning
Garment</i> and <i>James IV.</i>; (2) Greene himself provides the
prototype of Peele's lyric in his <i>Mourning Garment</i> verse
and its cognate form in <i>James IV.</i>; (3) or, as seems most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
probable, fragmentary strains that have been found are
reminiscences of a popular song that has not yet been
traced.</p>

<p>We have, a little arbitrarily perhaps, grouped the four
indubitable plays of Greene's unassisted composition in
order to formulate the developing characteristics of his
dramatic genius. Yet there are other plays that raise
problems no less interesting than those we have considered,
and that might, were we able unquestioningly to assign
them to Greene, go far to clarify the obscure places in his
biography and his art. That Greene had a part in <i>A
Looking-Glass for London and England</i> there is, of course,
no doubt, but we are not yet able to say how much of the
play is his composition, and the question of its date
provides some difficulties. We incline to the view that
it was an early play. Lodge was absent from England
in 1588 on a voyage with Captain Clark to the Islands of
Terceras and the Canaries. In August 1591 he sailed
from Plymouth with Cavendish and did not return until
1593, after Greene's death. <i>A Looking-Glass</i> was then
either written before 1588 or between 1589 and 1591.
Collins, arguing from passages in the play remotely
paralleled by biblical allusions in <i>Greene's Vision</i> and
the <i>Mourning Garment</i>, decides that it was produced in
1590. This conclusion cannot be accepted because, as
Collins himself admits, references to Nineveh and Jonas
are frequent in the literature of the time. Of the three
reasons given by Collins for supposing that the play was
not written before 1588 one is based on the slender
hypothesis that as it is not proved that Greene wrote plays
before 1590 this one could not have been earlier; and
another is based on a gratuitous assumption that this
play is that comedy "lastly writ" with "Young Juvenal"
and mentioned in <i>A Groatsworth of Wit.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The argument
that the realistic passage beginning "The fair Triones
with their glimmering light" could only have been written
after Lodge's first maritime experience carries more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
weight, but cannot stand long as against counter evidence
of any force whatever. Nor do we see any strength in
the theory that this play is a product of Greene's era of
repentance. As has been shown, Greene uses repentance
as a didactic motive from the first. Considering this as a
moralising play one may with better force place it in the
earlier years of less complex dramatic inspiration. It is
difficult to conceive that in 1589, when Greene was almost
certainly engaged in writing <i>Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay</i>, he should have been willing to go back to the
motive of the interludes. As the spirit of the play is
earlier than Greene's mature work, so its associations
are with the earlier rather than with the later work of
Lodge. <i>An Alarum against Usurers</i>, the influence of which
is often apparent, was published in 1584. In the years
from 1589 to 1591 inclusive Lodge was engaged on
another type of work, represented by <i>Scillæ's Metamorphosis,
Rosalynde, The History of Robert, second Duke of
Normandy</i>, and <i>Catharos</i>, certainly as far removed as
possible from the moralising vein of <i>A Looking-Glass</i>.
Two published expressions by Lodge lean rather to the
earlier than the later date. In <i>Scillæ's Metamorphosis</i>
(1589) Lodge vows,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"To write no more of that whence shame doth grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[Nor] tie my pen to penny-knaves delight."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Certainly we cannot believe that Lodge was abjuring
playwriting at the very moment that he was preparing
<i>A Looking-Glass</i>. The other passage occurs in Lodge's
<i>Wits Misery</i> (1596), in which Lodge says it is odious "in
stage plays to make use of historical scripture." This
passage should be viewed in connection with a passage in
the epistle prefixed to Greene's <i>Farewell to Folly</i> (1591),
taunting the author of <i>Fair Em</i> for "blasphemous
rhetoric," and for borrowing from the scripture. Whatever
may be the claims of consistency we must suppose that
the argument from good policy would tend to the conclusion
that the scriptural drama of Greene and Lodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
was written as long as possible before these uncompromising
words. Setting narrow limits, we should say that
<i>A Looking-Glass</i> was produced between the date of the
production of <i>Tamburlaine</i> and of the destruction of the
Spanish Armada. In the deification of Rasni, "god on
earth, and none but he," there are traces of an aspiring
kingliness, and the lament of Rasni over Remilia, his
queen, has the yearning note sounded in Tamburlaine's
grief over the dying Zenocrate. That the play was not
written during the intense excitement incident to the
Armada would seem probable on general principles, for
there is no hint either of imminent national danger or of
the intoxication of success. The undoubted reflections of
<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> in this play can serve only to place
it in near conjunction with <i>Orlando Furioso</i> as an early
play. Whether it preceded or followed that play it is
impossible now to decide.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> As to Greene's share in the
work it is impossible to speak with even the semblance of
authority. The comic portions sound like Greene's work,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and if Greene wrote Act v. scene 4 of <i>James IV.</i> he
was quite capable of writing the moralising part. In
simplicity of construction the play is quite unlike Greene's
other dramatic works, just as it is much better than
Lodge's <i>The Wounds of Civil War</i>. Arguing from the
position of their names on the title-page, one is tempted
to believe that the play was planned and drafted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
Lodge, and put forth by Greene somewhat after the
manner used in his edition of his friend's <i>Euphues Shadow</i>
(1592).</p>

<p>The anonymous authorship of <i>George-a-Greene, Locrine</i>
and <i>Selimus</i> provides problems that must continue to
vex critics for some time to come. None of them is
assigned to Greene on absolute evidence of any weight,
yet strong support has been given to the theory of
Greene's authorship of each of them. In the case of the
first so respectable has been the following that no editor
would care definitely to exclude the play from his list.
Yet the best evidence is questionable, and much of the
evidence is quite adverse to the theory of Greene's
authorship. The manuscript notes on a copy of the
Quarto of 1599, assigning the play to a minister who had
played the pinner's part himself, and in another hand to
Robert Greene (quoted on <a href="#Page_xxiii">p. xxiii.</a>), cannot to-day be considered
good evidence. Judged by the well-known tests
of textual and structural criticism the play almost
absolutely fails to connect itself either with Greene or
his contemporary university writers. Few plays of the
late eighties are so isolated from the clearly-marked characteristics
of the drama of the time. Of <i>Euphues</i>, of
<i>Tamburlaine</i>, of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, of Seneca, of the
religious play, there are few, if any, traces. The rhetorical
structure shows none of the artificial balances and climaxes
so common at the time; there is neither ghost, chorus,
dumb show nor messenger; there is no high aspiring
figure, no madness, no revenge; and the bloodshed is
decent. The lyrics are English and not Italian. Indeed
so far is it from the classical style that it seems difficult
to believe that a university man wrote the play. The
rich mythology of the university wits is entirely wanting.
Such classical allusions as are to be found are the stock
figures of a layman's vocabulary, Leda, Helena, Venus
and Hercules, the rudimentary mythology of the age. The
play lies nearer to the ground in an absolute realism of
the soil than any known in this group. The milk cans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
of <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> may be pure pastoral;
the country setting of <i>George-a-Greene</i> is pure rustic,
and is not helped at all by literature. So also the play
lacks many of Greene's characteristic notes. It was
performed at the Rose by Sussex' men, while so far as is
known Greene remained faithful to the Queen's company
throughout his life. It lacks that satirical under-current,
that ironic veiled counter cuff at his rivals, that personal
innuendo in the midst of a good story that is so characteristic
of Greene.</p>

<p>But in spite of the facts that are brought to his judgment
the beauties of the play are such as to compel every
editor to soften judgment by inclination and include the
play among Greene's dramas. Certainly Greene is the
only university man of his day who, knowing the
affectations of literature, at the same time knew real life
in the concrete well enough to write <i>George-a-Greene</i>.
If truth were told it was through plays of the type
of <i>George-a-Greene</i>, rather than through the more ambitious
university men's plays, that the current of pure
English comedy was to flow. And it is because <i>George-a-Greene</i>
integrates itself so perfectly with the development
of Greene's dramatic genius, and represents so well
that realism reached by a settling down of art from
above, rather than arising from the vulgar fact, that we
are willing to say that if Greene did not write this play
he could have written one much like it. <i>George-a-Greene</i>
seems to bring to consummation the developing principles
of Greene's art. As in the case of <i>Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay</i> there is in this play a quite unhistorical chronicle
element concerning English kings. But unlike <i>James IV.</i>,
which is derived from an Italian original, this play tells
an English story based on the native Robin Hood
strain. Again, like <i>Friar Bacon</i>, the original story,
which contains no romantic element, is augmented by a
love story. If the play is Greene's it may represent the
last and purest expression of his charming doctrine of
beauty and his simple philosophy of content. To Greene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
beauty lay in fresh and joyous colours and in uncomplex
forms. And his philosophy of repose is evolved out of
the sublimation of the emotional riot of his early life.
Again and again these notes are struck in <i>George-a-Greene</i>.
Now it is the well-known strain:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The sweet content of men that live in love</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Breeds fretting humours in a restless mind."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Again it is contentment put into better precept:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"a poor man that is true</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is better than an earl, if he be false;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'tis more credit to men of base degree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To do great deeds, than men of dignity."</span><br />
</p>

<p>George's words, "Tell me, sweet love, how is thy
mind content," "Happy am I to have so sweet a love,"
and "I have a lovely leman, as bright of blee as is the
silver moon," sound like Greene's style matured and
softened by experience. Yet that the play is Greene's
one would not dare to say. Its present form displays
either hasty composition or garbled version, or both, for
it is neither consistent nor well integrated. In one
breath Cuddy has never seen George, and in the next
delivers to King Edward a message which "at their
parting George did say to me." The episodes of Jane-a-Barley,
Cuddy and Musgrove, George-a-Greene and the
horses in the corn, the shoemakers and the "Vail Staff"
custom, Robin Hood and his followers, are but fragments
thinly and crudely knit together. Perhaps this play is a
unique exemplar of a class of hurriedly-sketched popular
plays written by Greene for the provinces and printed
from a mutilated stage copy.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Lamentable Tragedy of Locrine</i> has been ascribed
to Shakespeare, Marlowe, Peele and Greene. The two
former ascriptions are clearly uncritical, and the two
latter present many difficulties. According to Symonds,
"The best passages of the play ... are very much in the
manner of Greene." In this opinion joins Brooke, the
editor of <i>The Shakespeare Apocrypha</i>. With certain
portions of the argument associating <i>Locrine</i> with Greene
we are in harmony. The play was issued by that Thomas
Creede who had published Greene's <i>Alphonsus of Arragon,
A Looking-Glass</i>, and <i>James IV.</i> In flashes of poetry,
in classical allusion, in high-sounding phrases, the play is
sometimes astoundingly in the temper of <i>Orlando Furioso</i>
and <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i>. We care little for the evidence
that is deduced from literal parallels. More often
than not these were purposed copyings or imitations, or
involuntary reminiscences of lingering refrains. But
there is such a thing as an author's peculiar verbal
coin, which is stamped with his sign, and can be
paid out by him alone. One who knows his author well
cannot but be struck with the frequent occurrence of
Greene's own turn of phrase, a style that is clearly to
be distinguished from the style of any other poet of his
time. Brutus' salutation to his followers at the beginning
of the play is much after the manner of Marsilius' welcome
to the princes who were come to woo Angelica.
Trumpart's imprecations by "sticks and stones," "brickbats
and bones," "briars and brambles," "cook shops
and shambles," remind one of Orlando's equally ludicrous
"Woods, trees, leaves; leaves, trees, woods." The
lyrical clownery of Strumbo is often strikingly like that
of Miles in <i>Friar Bacon</i>. The senile revenge motive
of Corineus resembles that of Carinus in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.
The use of the capital founded by Brutus, Troynovant,
is repeated in <i>Never too Late</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> So also Guendoline's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
pleas for the life of her faithless husband&mdash;"his death
will more augment my woes"&mdash;are quite in the spirit of
Dorothea's pity for her sinning husband in <i>James IV.</i>
Strumbo's use of his plackets to hide food in while
Humber is starving resembles in comic intent Adam's
same expedient in starving Nineveh. Certain verse
propositions seem to ring with Greene's own timbre:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The poorest state is farthest from annoy" (ii. 2, 37).<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"After we passed the groves of Caledone.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where murmuring rivers slide with silent streams,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We did behold the straggling Scythians camp," etc. (ii. 3, 23).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Why this, my lord, experience teaches us:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That resolution is a sole help at need" (iii. 2, 61).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, that sweet face painted with nature's dye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Those roseall cheeks mixt with a snowy white,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That decent neck surpassing ivory" (iv. 1, 91).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<i>Loc.</i> Better to live, than not to live at all.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Estrild.</i> Better to die renowned for chastity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than live with shame and endless infamy." (iv. 1, 133)<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Other minor phrases that are even more characteristic
of Greene's note are, "daughters of proud Lebanon,"
"Aurora, handmaid of the sun," "party coloured
flowers," "shady groves" (often repeated), "girt with a
corselet of bright shining steel," "rascal runnagates,"
"overlook with haughty front," "injurious fortune,"
and "injurious traitor," "watery" (frequently repeated
even where unnecessary), "silver streams" (often repeated),
"sweet savours," "regiment," "argent
streams," "university of bridewell" (to be compared
with Miles' jests), "uncouth rock," "Puryflegiton"
(often used; Greene uses Phlegethon), "Anthropophagie,"
"countercheck," "triple world," "beauty's paragon,"
"those her so pleasing looks," "straggling" (as an
adjective expressing contempt; often used, and quite
characteristic of Greene).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The considerations outlined are sufficient to incline
one favourably toward the theory of Greene's authorship
of <i>Locrine</i>. Yet the difficulties are such as for the present
to deny the play a place among Greene's works. The date
is in great doubt. The first edition of 1595 "newly set
forth, overseen and corrected by W. S.," is evidently a
revamped version. We cannot agree with Brooke that
the play appeared before <i>Tamburlaine</i>, for, among many
strains of the dramas of <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i>
type there are mingled undoubted influences from the
revenge plays and <i>Tamburlaine</i>. It is difficult to adjust
the play to any scheme of activities that has been worked
out for Greene. Certainly it did not ante-date <i>Alphonsus
of Arragon</i>, for there is every reason to take the prologue
of that play at its word. Upon the hypothesis that it is
Greene's work we should place it just before <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>, the play which it resembles above all others,
and about the same time as <i>A Looking-Glass for London
and England</i>, which in respect of comedy it greatly
resembles.</p>

<p>It is impossible to view with any favour the theory of
Greene's authorship of <i>Selimus</i>. In every respect the
play is divergent from Greene's characteristic tone and
method. Grosart's theory that this play may be supposed
to take the place of the promised second part of <i>Alphonsus
of Arragon</i> has no weight. Like the latter play <i>Selimus</i>
is the first part of a work that had been planned in series,
and in no respect does it supplement Greene's first play.
Like <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i> the play is constructed with
such slavish fidelity to the <i>Tamburlaine</i> principles that it
is difficult to think Greene could have written <i>Selimus</i>
after the failure of <i>Alphonsus</i>. Constructively the play is
unlike Greene's work. The declamation is more sustained
and the action is less crowded than in Greene's
other plays. The many parallel passages quoted by
Grosart prove nothing more than that borrowing was the
order of the age. Nor is anything proved by the fact
that the same clown comedy is introduced into <i>Locrine</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
<i>Selimus</i> and <i>A Looking-Glass for London and England</i>.
If <i>Locrine</i> is Greene's work it was probably written about
the time that he was collaborating with Lodge, and he
may have introduced the same comedy into both plays.
It is no more of an assumption that the author of <i>Selimus</i>
borrowed his comedy from <i>Locrine</i> than that Greene
would use the same tricks three times within two years.
The blank verse of <i>Selimus</i>, built largely on a system
of rhymed stanzas, is very far from that of <i>Locrine</i> and
of Greene's undoubted plays. To illustrate this no
better passages could be chosen than those produced by
Collins to evidence the similarity of the verse of the two
plays. The vexed problem of the part taken by Greene
in the <i>Henry VI.</i> plays can be treated now only as a
subject for interesting but comparatively fruitless speculation.
So also must be considered the ingenious and
almost convincing circumstantial argument that <i>A Knack
to Know a Knave</i> is the comedy "lastly writ" by
Greene and "Young Juvenal," and mentioned in <i>A
Groatsworth of Wit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We said in beginning that Greene is clearly typical
of his time. And indeed his plays are complexes of
the dominant dramatic types of the years just before
Shakespeare. In his work are focused the strains
leading from the three most clearly marked dramatic
movements of the age. The English morality combines
with rustic low life to produce the interlude,
which continues its course of didacticism and horse-play
until the end of the century. The Senecan drama
scatters ghosts and horrors through English plays until
it is etherealised in the poetry of <i>Tamburlaine</i>, and
laughed to death in the parodies of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
The English chronicle play gives life to the dry bones of
history, and celebrates the solidarity of an England
united over the face of the globe, and through all the eras
of her splendid history. Of all these elements the one
that remains in Greene's work from beginning to end is
the didactic strain. <i>A Looking-Glass for London and
England</i> is the last full flowering of English religious
drama. Yet didactic elements appear in Friar Bacon's
strangely unmotivated repentance, and in the interpolated
scene of a lawyer, a merchant and a divine in
<i>James IV.</i> In Greene's dramas many of the types and
figures from a bygone stage are mingled with the newer
creations of his invention. The vices of the interludes
spring up incongruously in the midst of the characters of a
later drama. In <i>Friar Bacon</i> the Vice is again carried off
to hell on the back of the Devil, just as had been done
years before in simpler plays; and in the same play, by the
use of the expedient of perspective glasses, two actions
are represented as taking place in widely separate
localities, after the manner of the early masques. And
aside from these persisting formulas from an older drama
there are influences and obligations in relation with Lyly
and Marlowe and Kyd that are literally too numerous for
enumeration. As significant as any service Greene performed
for English drama is the assimilation to a single
dramatic end of the adverse expedients of a heterogeneous
dramaturgy.</p>

<p>Technically Greene's contribution to the stage was most
significant. Nash called him master above all others in
"plotting of plays." Part of this mastery comes from
his recognition of the technical requirement of continuous
action on the stage. Better than any of his contemporaries,
not excluding Kyd, he knew that action is of
equal importance with speech in the exposition of a
dramatic story. Wherever possible he visualises before
his audience the successive stages in the progress of his
plot, not by the use of ghosts and chorus, who serve
merely a narrative purpose, but by bringing before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
readers palpable expedients illustrative of the theme of
the action. The use of the Brazen Head in <i>Alphonsus of
Arragon</i>; the incantations of Melissa in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>;
the raising of the arbor, and the death of Remilia under
the incantations of the Magi in <i>A Looking-Glass for London
and England</i>; the use of a visible magic to transport
Burden and Helen, to raise Hercules and the tree, and to
present the downfall of the Brazen Head in <i>Friar Bacon</i>,
all reveal an ability to adapt the properties and expedients
of the stage of the time to the purposes of the
plot. This is further exemplified in the facility with
which from the beginning Greene utilises such spectacular
expedients as the letting down of the throne of Venus
from above in <i>Alphonsus of Arragon</i>, and the descent of
the throne of Oseas the prophet in <i>A Looking-Glass</i>.
Not only does he use the palpable tricks of stagecraft,
but he adapts these to the purposes of his dramatic
exposition. The perspective glass in <i>Friar Bacon</i> which
serves to present two scenes at the same time serves also
to connect two strains of the plot and to further the action
by arousing Prince Edward's suspicion of the fidelity of
Lacy. So magic, which in <i>Dr Faustus</i> serves only to
raise a spectacle, in this play is used as a plot expedient to
delay the marriage of Margaret and Lacy. The stage
directions are more full and circumstantial in Greene's
plays than in those of either Marlowe or Peele, and reveal
the same tendency to heighten the effect of plot by action
and display.</p>

<p>Greene's dramas present a steady development in
effectiveness of plot involution. The first plays are
marked by a large amount of action and a great number
of narrative fragments very crudely and inorganically
clustered around the central character. <i>Alphonsus of
Arragon</i> is Greene's poorest work in this as in every other
respect. Its first act is marked by hesitation and indirection;
accident, coincidence and inconsistency are the rule
throughout. The play is practically divided into two parts,
in the first of which Alphonsus is the central figure, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
Amurack serves as protagonist in the second. <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> is structurally an improvement on its predecessor,
and in <i>A Looking-Glass for London and England</i>
an excellent unity of action has been attained. It is in
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> that Greene effected the
most substantial advance in play technique made before
Shakespeare. This is nothing less than the weaving of
two distinct plots into the unity of a single dramatic
narrative. On account of the crowding of the action
and the sensations, the play is unbalanced and unorganised.
<i>Friar Bacon's</i> activities are divided into two
distinct parts, his victory over Vandermast and his loss
of the Brazen Head, and they are scattered through a
half-dozen episodes. For perfect balance Prince Edward
surrenders Margaret too early in the play and thus makes
necessary the introduction of further retarding action
based upon an unexplainable whim of Lacy. Yet granting
the inchoate character of the play we must admit that
in effecting the combination of the story of Friar Bacon
with the story of Prince Edward, Lacy and the Fair Maid
of Fressingfield, Greene accomplished an unusually significant
innovation. In <i>James IV.</i> Greene's technique is at
its best. Even in the faulty version that comes down to
us we see traces of Greene's experimenting temper. In
dumb shows he is reinstating a popular feature of older
plays. His induction serves as a model for Shakespeare's
<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>; and one of its characters, Oberon,
is a rough draft for the fairy of that name in <i>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>, as Bohan is a prototype of
Jaques in <i>As You Like It</i>. But Greene's induction is
better integrated with his play than is Shakespeare's
induction of Sly, the Lords and the Servants, for the two
characters, Slipper and Nano, who appear first in the
induction, are sent out into the play to serve as connecting
links for all of its action. <i>James IV.</i> is the only
one of Greene's plays that has unity of action. The plot
is introduced with a masterly directness and economy.
The fatal situation breaks on the reader at the beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
and throughout the play the crux of the action remains
the love of the King of Scots for another than his queen.
Ateukin springs up at the psychological moment and at
the dramatic crisis. The first act of the play, dramatically
quite the best first act written outside of Shakespeare
up to his time, provides the king's marriage to
Dorothea, the revelation of his love for Ida, the enlistment
of Ateukin in the cause of the king's love, and a lover
for Ida to make her inaccessible. Aside from the development
of the tragedy of this situation there enters into the
play only one minor episode, the love of Lady Anderson
for the young knight (in reality Queen Dorothea) whom
she is succouring in her castle. That Greene chose to end
the play after the manner of comedy, and not, as the
situation would seem to require, and the taste of
the age must have demanded, with the death of
the erring king, is an effective indication of his
later freedom from restraint and of his personal
philosophy of art.</p>

<p>As Marlowe moved from the sublime passion of his
<i>Tamburlaine</i> theme to the cold reserve of his <i>Edward II.</i>,
Greene also, casting off the turgid eloquence of his early
style, attained at the end to an art of contemplative
repose and genial humanity. The critic likes to feel that
in stripping away the excrescences from his art he was
discovering his own soul. In treating Greene as a representative
Elizabethan, one should not ignore the individuality
of the man that stamps all his work with a new
impress. Without being original in structure or style
Greene was individual in outlook and temper. He had a
keener eye for the little things than any dramatist of his
time, and he had also a better sympathy for the quick
flashing moods and manifestations of human character.
His knowledge of the concrete realities of character is an
attribute of the man himself. In depicting fairies he
lacks, as did Lyly, the imagination to vitalise an unreal
world in the spirit of a Shakespeare. He chooses his
characters from the world around him and studies them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
in their native habitat. His clowns, though belonging
to an ancient family, are racy of the soil of England, and
are fellows with Shadow, and Launce, and Speed and
Grumio. Warren and Ermsby are Englishmen of a
sturdy type, and Sir Cuthbert Anderson and Lady
Anderson are studied as if in their Scotch castle. But
Greene did something more than present the exteriors of
men as types. He studied their psychology, and knew
the warring forces within the individual soul, the power of
circumstance, and ambition, and love to direct the forces
of character into untoward paths. He knew that logic
of human nature that counts consistency untrue, and
constructs motives out of the syllogisms of perversity.
So he divides the part of the Capitano, in the original story
upon which <i>James IV.</i> was based, into two parts, one the
working intelligence, Ateukin, and the other the executioner,
Jaques. So also the King of Scots is no puppet.
He struggles as he falls, and his fall is reflected in his
distraught mind. And in the depiction of women Greene
lavishes the finest forces of his genius. Nash called him
"the Homer of women," and that phrase is worth the
entirety of <i>Strange News</i> in defending Greene's fame.
Sometimes he goes to his own baser experience for his
comment, and then there is, as in <i>Orlando Furioso</i> (<a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>),
a touch of the awful invective delivered against prostitutes
in his <i>Never too Late</i>. But Greene's later art was
better than this. Scottish Ida, who wins the heart of
the King of Scots from English Doll, is no courtesan.
Something of the respect and love that breathes through
Greene's allusions to Doll his wife is seen in his treatment
of all womankind. Even Angelica in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
unformed as are her outlines, represents that fidelity of a
patient Grizzel so well exemplified in Margaret in <i>Friar
Bacon</i> and Dorothea in <i>James IV.</i> Nothing in Marlowe's
Queen Isabella of <i>Edward II.</i>, Zenocrate of <i>Tamburlaine</i>,
Abigail of <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, can equal the sweet and
simple womanliness of Greene's gallery, comprising Isabel
in <i>Never too Late</i>, Bellaria and Fawnia in <i>Pandosto</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
Sephestia in <i>Menaphon</i>, Philomela and the shepherd's
wife in the <i>Mourning Garment</i>, Margaret in <i>Friar Bacon
and Friar Bungay</i>, and Ida and Dorothea in <i>James IV.</i></p>

<p>Greene's skill in the treatment of character grew out of
his knowledge of life, and is involved in his most significant
and enduring contribution to the stage. This is
the introduction of realism onto a stage that was essentially
romantic, and it arises from the application of
dramatic art to the experiences of everyday life. Greene's
low life is not artificial pastoral, nor is it the boorish
clownage of the interludes. It is the characteristic life
of England that we see in Harrison's <i>Description</i>, refined
and beautified by a mature and chastened art. Only in
such art can come the homely ideal of "beauty tempered
with ... huswifery." By the time of <i>Friar Bacon and
Friar Bungay</i> Greene's art has come home. Now in a
series of domestic thumb sketches he shows us Margaret:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And there amongst the cream bowls she did shine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As Pallas 'mongst her princely huswifery,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and the hostess in the kitchen,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Spitting the meat 'gainst supper for my guess,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and the hay, and butter, and cheese displays of Harleston
fair. "He was of singular pleasaunce, the very supporter,
and, to no man's disgrace be this intended, the
only comedian, of a vulgar writer, in this country," writes
Chettle in <i>A Kind Hart's Dream</i>, summing up in striking
phrase the true contemporary judgment of Greene's
greatest distinction. But there is another aspect of his
genius. He loved the active life of out-of-doors, and he
indulged a vigorous spirit of participation in the life
around him. But he saw behind things into the spirit,
and his treatment of events is dignified with a rich philosophy
drawn from his manifold contact with the most
lavish era in England's history. To him a drama is more
than an isolated and a meaningless show. In <i>Francesco's
Fortunes</i> he outlines the kind of play that he himself
wrote: "Therein they painted out in the persons the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
course of the world, how either it was graced with honour,
or discredited with vices." He leaves the hollow-sounding
verbiage of his early plays to comment with the lawyer
on "the manners and the fashions of this age." His
<i>James IV.</i> is a play of contemplation. Bohan is an early
"malcontent," and Andrew, noting the downfall of his
prince, exclaims, "Was never such a world, I think,
before." With the heart of a democrat Greene understands
alike the problems of kings and yeomen. The
counsel of the King of England to Dorothea on the
obligations and dangers of sovereignty is sage and
rational, and Ida's comments on the "greatest good"&mdash;that
it lies not "in delights, or pomp, or majesty"&mdash;are
rich with the best philosophy. In <i>A Quip for an
Upstart Courtier</i> Clothbreeches asks, "Doth true virtue
consist in riches, or humanity in wealth? is ancient
honour tied to outward bravery? or not rather true
nobility, a mind excellently qualified with rare virtues?"
So often is this note struck in Greene's plays that we
might call it a personal one were it not that it is beginning
to appear commonly in the literature of the time.</p>

<p>Summing up Greene's contribution to the drama of his
age we should say that it lies in the essential comedy of
his outlook on life, his inherent <i>vis comica</i>; in his loving
insight into human nature in its familiar aspects; in his
distrust of exaggeration and his tendency to turn this to
burlesque; and in his beautiful philosophy of the eternal
verities. Out of the drama of Greene there developed
the new romantic comedy of Shakespeare and the realism
of joy of domestic drama. After <i>George-a-Greene</i> there
came the Huntingdon plays of Munday and Chettle, in
which the woodland knight, Robin Hood, appears again.
After <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> there came <i>Fair Em,
A Knack to Know a Knave, John-a-Kent and John-a-Cumber,</i>
and Dekker's <i>Shoemaker's Holiday</i>. Heywood
and Samuel Rowley and Munday and Dekker and the
author of <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> share with Shakespeare
indisputable strains of his individual note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Herford calls attention to the conflict, in
Greene's life, between "the fresh, unworn sense of beauty
and poetry," and "the bitter, disillusioned cynicism of
premature old age." That conflict was a necessary one.
It was present also in the discrepancy between the lyric
note of Marlowe's yearning fancy and the hard reserve
laid upon his later pen by bitter suffering. Both of these
were true Elizabethans. They were true to their times
in the vastness of their conceptions and in the narrowness
of their lives, in their poetic triumphs no less than in their
personal defeats. The marvellous thing is that in the
midst of riotous life they should have learned repose in
art, that though writing in a tavern their muse should
have remained chaste. Marlowe remained to the end
the poet of "air and fire." From Greene we get in the
drama the first clear note of the English woodland joy
that had echoed fitfully in English non-dramatic verse
from the days of Chaucer and the unknown author of
<i>Alysoun</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Groatsworth of Wit</i> has been so often cited as a record
in the history of English drama that its value as a human
document has been forgotten. Of Greene's attack
therein on Shakespeare there is no need to say anything
here. To those who have any concern with Greene
himself it is interesting chiefly for its revelation of the
awful melancholy of his last days and his pathetic sense
of the wrongs suffered by the little school of dramatists of
which he was a member. The sense of pity produced by
reading this book is intensified by a study of Greene's
last days as suggested in his own succeeding book, <i>The
Repentance of Robert Greene</i>, and in the pamphlets of
Harvey and Nash. Greene died on the 3rd of September
1592, of a malady following a surfeit of Rhenish wine
and pickled herring. Before his death he received commendations
from his wife, and his last written words were
addressed to her in a request to pay the debt incurred by
his sickness. We are told that after his death the keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
of his garret crowned his head with bays. Fourteen
years later, when, with the exception of Lodge, the last
of the university wits had passed away, and Shakespeare,
whom they had all feared, had taken his abiding place,
Dekker in his tract, <i>A Knight's Coiffuring</i>, shows Marlowe,
Greene and Peele, together once more in Elysium, under
the "shades of a large vine, laughing to see Nash, that
was but newly come to their college, still haunted with the
sharp and satirical spirit that had followed him here upon
earth."</p>

OF ARRAGON</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>


<p>The first extant edition of <i>Alphonsus, King of Arragon</i>, was
printed in quarto by Thomas Creede in 1599. Lowndes mentions
a quarto of 1597 of which no trace can be found. Of the two
copies of the quarto of 1599 now known, one is in the library of
the Duke of Devonshire, and the other is in the Dyce Library at
South Kensington. <i>Alphonsus</i> is not mentioned by Henslowe in
his <i>Diary</i>, nor is there any record of the play in the Stationers'
Registers. Nothing certain can be said concerning the circumstances
and dates of composition and first performance of Greene's plays.
But there can be no doubt that this is one of Greene's earliest plays,
for in the Prologue Greene says through the mouth of Venus:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And this my hand, which usèd for to pen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The praise of love and Cupid's peerless power,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will now begin to treat of bloody Mars."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nor can there be any doubt that the play was written in imitation
of Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i>, mention of which occurs in IV. 3. A
second part, "when I come to finish up his life," is promised in the
Epilogue. That the second part was not written is probably an
indication of the failure of the piece. In the Preface to Greene's
<i>Perimedes</i> of 29th March 1588, we learn that two "gentlemen
poets" had caused two actors to mock Greene's motto, <i>Omne tulit
punctum</i>, because his verse fell short of the bombast and blasphemy
of Marlowe's early style. It has been suggested that it may have
been the verse of <i>Alphonsus</i> that was ridiculed. Certainly it must
have been this play, or a lost early play, for it was in drama that
the "mighty line" appeared. There is in Peele's <i>Farewell</i>, April
1589, a reference to a piece of mechanism occurring in this play
which closely connects it with Marlowe's first play, "Mahomet's
Poo and mighty Tamburlaine." This has been discussed in the
<a href="#Page_xxxiii">General Introduction</a>. Greene's play is based distantly on the
history of Alphonso I. of Naples and V. of Arragon (1385-1454),
though with no pretence to historical accuracy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>After you have sounded thrice, let</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span> <i>be let down from

<p>
<i>Venus.</i> Poets are scarce, when goddesses themselves<br />
Are forc'd to leave their high and stately seats,<br />
Plac'd on the top of high Olympus' Mount,<br />
To seek them out, to pen their champions' praise.<br />
The time hath been when Homer's sugar'd Muse<br />
Did make each echo to repeat his verse,<br />
That every coward that durst crack a spear,<br />
And tilt and tourney for his lady's sake,<br />
Was painted out in colours of such price<br />
As might become the proudest potentate.<br />

And cursèd charms have witch'd each student's mind,<br />
That death it is to any of them all,<br />
If that their hands to penning you do call.<br />
O Virgil, Virgil, wert thou now alive,<br />
Whose painful pen, in stout Augustus' days,<br />
Did dain<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to let the base and silly fly<br />
To scape away without thy praise of her,<br />
I do not doubt but long or ere this time,<br />
Alphonsus' fame unto the heavens should climb;<br />
Alphonsus' fame, that man of Jove his seed,<br />
Sprung from the loins of the immortal gods,<br />
Whose sire, although he habit on the earth,<br />
May claim a portion in the fiery pole,<br />
As well as any one whate'er he be.<br />
But, setting by Alphonsus' power divine,<br />
What man alive, or now amongst the ghosts,<br />
Could countervail his courage and his strength?<br />
But thou art dead, yea, Virgil, thou art gone,<br />
And all his acts drown'd in oblivion.<br />
And all his acts drown'd in oblivion?<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><br />
No, Venus, no, though poets prove unkind,<br />
And loth to stand in penning of his deeds,<br />
Yet rather than they shall be clean forgot,<br />
I, which was wont to follow Cupid's games<br />
Will put in ure<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Minerva's sacred art;<br />
And this my hand, which usèd for to pen<br />
The praise of love and Cupid's peerless power,<br />
Will now begin to treat of bloody Mars,<br />
Of doughty deeds and valiant victories.<br />

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Near Naples.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carinus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cari.</i> My noble son, since first I did recount<br />
The noble acts your predecessors did<br />
In Arragon against their warlike foes,<br />
I never yet could see thee joy at all,<br />
But hanging down thy head as malcontent,<br />
Thy youthful days in mourning have been spent.<br />
Tell me, Alphonsus, what might be the cause<br />
That makes thee thus to pine away with care?<br />
Hath old Carinus done thee any offence<br />
In reckoning up these stories unto thee?<br />
What ne'er a word but mum? Alphonsus, speak,<br />
Unless your father's fatal day you seek.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Although, dear father, I have often vow'd<br />
Ne'er to unfold the secrets of my heart<br />
To any man or woman, whosome'er<br />
Dwells underneath the circle of the sky;<br />
Yet do your words so cónjure me, dear sire,<br />
That needs I must fulfil that you require.<br />
Then so it is. Amongst the famous tales<br />
Which you rehears'd done by our sires in war,<br />
Whenas you came unto your father's days,<br />
With sobbing notes, with sighs and blubbering tears,<br />
And much ado, at length you thus began:<br />
"Next to Alphonsus should my father come<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>For to possess the diadem by right<br />
Of Arragon, but that the wicked wretch<br />
His younger brother, with aspiring mind,<br />
By secret treason robb'd him of his life,<br />
And me his son of that which was my due."<br />
These words, my sire, did so torment my mind,<br />
As had I been with Ixion<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in hell,<br />
The ravening bird could never plague me worse;<br />
For ever since my mind hath troubled been<br />
Which way I might revenge this traitorous fact,<br />
And that recover which is ours by right.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Ah, my Alphonsus, never think on that!<br />
In vain it is to strive against the stream:<br />
The crown is lost, and now in hucksters' hands,<br />
And all our hope is cast into the dust.<br />
Bridle these thoughts, and learn the same of me,&mdash;<br />
A quiet life doth pass an empery.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Yet, noble father, ere Carinus' brood<br />
Shall brook his foe for to usurp his seat,<br />

And so his life and sorrows briefly end.<br />
But did I know my froward fate were such<br />
As I should fail in this my just attempt,<br />
This sword, dear father, should the author be<br />
To make an end of this my tragedy.<br />
Therefore, sweet sire, remain you here a while,<br />

Against their treason, shortly was forewarn'd<br />
Ne'er more to haunt the bounds of Arragon,<br />
On pain of death. Then like a man forlorn,<br />
I sought about to find some resting-place,<br />
And at the length did hap upon this shore,<br />
Where showing forth my cruel banishment,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>By King Belinus I am succourèd.<br />
But now, my lord, to answer your demand:<br />
It happens so, that the usurping king<br />
Of Arragon makes war upon this land<br />
For certain tribute which he claimeth here;<br />
Wherefore Belinus sent me round about<br />
His country for to gather up [his] men<br />
For to withstand this most injurious foe;<br />
Which being done, returning with the king,<br />
Despitefully I did so taunt your grace,<br />
Imagining you had some soldier been,<br />
The which, for fear, had sneakèd from the camp.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Enough, Albinius, I do know thy mind:<br />
But may it be that these thy happy news<br />
Should be of truth, or have you forgèd them?<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> The gods forbid that e'er Albinius' tongue<br />
Should once be found to forge a feignèd tale,<br />
Especially unto his sovereign lord:<br />
But if Alphonsus think that I do feign,<br />
Stay here a while, and you shall plainly see<br />
My words be true, whenas you do perceive<br />
Our royal army march before your face;<br />
The which, if't please my noble lord to stay,<br />
I'll hasten on with all the speed I may.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Make haste, Albinius, if you love my life;<br />
But yet beware, whenas your army comes,<br />
You do not make as though you do me know,<br />
For I a while a soldier base will be,<br />
Until I find time more convenient<br />
To show, Albinius, what is mine intent.<br />
<br />

Albinius for his profit best will deem. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

Do join their powers to raise Alphonsus' fame;<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Belinus, Albinius, Fabius</span>, <i>marching with their</i>
Soldiers; <i>they make a stand.</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span> <i>discovered
at one side.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Beli.</i> Thus far, my lords, we trainèd have our camp<br />
For to encounter haughty Arragon,<br />
Who with a mighty power of straggling mates<br />
Hath traitorously assailèd this our land,<br />
And burning towns, and sacking cities fair,<br />
Doth play the devil wheresome'er he comes.<br />
Now, as we are informèd of our scouts,<br />
He marcheth on unto our chiefest seat,<br />
Naples, I mean, that city of renown,<br />
For to begirt it with his bands about,<br />
And so at length, the which high Jove forbid,<br />
To sack the same, as erst he other did.<br />
If which should hap, Belinus were undone,<br />
His country spoil'd, and all his subjects slain:<br />
Wherefore your sovereign thinketh it most meet<br />
For to prevent the fury of the foe,<br />
And Naples succour, that distressèd town,<br />
By entering in, ere Arragon doth come,<br />
With all our men, which will sufficient be<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>For to withstand their cruel battery.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> The silly serpent, found by country swain,<br />
And cut in pieces by his furious blows,<br />
Yet if her head do 'scape away untouch'd,<br />
As many write, it very strangely goes<br />
To fetch an herb, with which in little time<br />
Her batter'd corpse again she doth conjoin:<br />
But if by chance the ploughman's sturdy staff<br />
Do hap to hit upon the serpent's head,<br />
And bruise the same, though all the rest be sound<br />
Yet doth the silly serpent lie for dead,<br />
Nor can the rest of all her body serve<br />
To find a salve which may her life preserve.<br />
Even so, my lord, if Naples once be lost,<br />
Which is the head of all your grace's land,<br />
Easy it were for the malicious foe<br />
To get the other cities in their hand:<br />
But if from them that Naples town be free,<br />
I do not doubt but safe the rest shall be;<br />
And therefore, mighty king, I think it best,<br />
To succour Naples rather than the rest.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> 'Tis bravely spoken; by my crown I swear,<br />
I like thy counsel, and will follow it.<br />
But hark, Albinius, dost thou know the man,<br />
That doth so closely overthwart us stand?<br />
[<i>Pointing towards</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Not I, my lord, nor never saw him yet.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Then, prithee, go and ask him presently,<br />
What countryman he is, and why he comes<br />
Into this place? perhaps he is some one,<br />
That is sent hither as a secret spy<br />
To hear and see in secret what we do.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fabius</span> <i>go toward</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> My friend, what art thou, that so like a spy<br />
Dost sneak about Belinus' royal camp?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><i>Alphon.</i> I am a man.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> A man! we know the same:<br />
But prithee, tell me, and set scoffing by,<br />
What countryman thou art, and why you come,<br />
That we may soon resolve the king thereof?<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Why, say I am a soldier.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> Of whose band?<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Of his that will most wages to me give.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> But will you be<br />
Content to serve Belinus in his wars?<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Ay, if he'll reward me as I do deserve,<br />
And grant whate'er I win, it shall be mine<br />
Incontinent.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Believe me, sir, your service costly is:<br />
But stay a while, and I will bring you word<br />
What King Belinus says unto the same.<br />
[<i>Goes towards</i> <span class="smcap">Belinus</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> What news, Albinius? who is that we see?<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> It is, my lord, a soldier that you see,<br />
Who fain would serve your grace in these your wars,<br />
But that, I fear, his service is too dear.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Too dear, why so? what doth the soldier crave?<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> He craves, my lord, all things that with his sword<br />
He doth obtain, whatever that they be.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>]. Content, my friend; if thou wilt succour me,<br />
Whate'er you get, that challenge as thine own;<br />
Belinus gives it frankly unto thee,<br />
Although it be the crown of Arragon.<br />
Come on, therefóre, and let us hie apace<br />
To Naples town, whereas by this, I know,<br />
Our foes have pitch'd their tents against our walls.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> March on, my lord, for I will follow you;<br />
And do not doubt but, ere the time be long,<br />
I shall obtain the crown of Arragon. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

Alphonsus 'gins by step and step to climb<br />

From banish'd state, as you have plainly seen,<br />
He is transform'd into a soldier's life,<br />
And marcheth in the ensign of the king<br />
Of worthy Naples, which Belinus hight;<br />
Not for because that he doth love him so,<br />
But that he may revenge him on his foe.<br />
Now on the top of lusty barbèd steed<br />

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Battle-field.</i></h4>


<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Flaminius</span> <i>on one side,</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>
<i>on the other. They fight</i>; <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span> <i>kills</i> <span class="smcap">Flaminius</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Alphon.</i> Go pack thou hence unto the Stygian lake,<br />
And make report unto thy traitorous sire<br />
How well thou hast enjoy'd the diadem<br />
Which he by treason set upon thy head;<br />
And if he ask thee who did send thee down,<br />
Alphonsus say, who now must wear thy crown.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lælius</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Læli.</i> Traitor, how dar'st thou look me in the face,<br />
Whose mighty king thou traitorously hast slain?<br />
What, dost thou think Flaminius hath no friends<br />
For to revenge his death on thee again?<br />
Yes, be you sure that, ere you 'scape from hence,<br />
Thy gasping ghost shall bear him company,<br />
Or else myself, fighting for his defence,<br />
Will be content by those thy hands to die.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Lælius, few words would better thee become,<br />
Especially as now the case doth stand;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>And didst thou know whom thou dost threaten thus,<br />
We should you have more calmer out of hand:<br />
For, Lælius, know that I Alphonsus am,<br />
The son and heir to old Carinus, whom<br />
The traitorous father of Flaminius<br />
Did secretly bereave his diadem.<br />
But see the just revenge of mighty Jove!<br />
The father dead, the son is likewise slain<br />
By that man's hand who they did count as dead,<br />
Yet doth survive to wear the diadem,<br />
When they themselves accompany the ghosts<br />
Which wander round about the Stygian fields.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Lælius</span> <i>gazes upon</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
Muse not hereat, for it is true I say;<br />
I am Alphonsus, whom thou hast misus'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> The man whose death I did so oft lament?<br />
[<i>Kneels.</i><br />
Then pardon me for these uncourteous words,<br />
The which I in my rage did utter forth,<br />
Prick'd by the duty of a loyal mind;<br />
Pardon, Alphonsus, this my first offence,<br />
And let me die if e'er I flight<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> again.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Lælius, I fain would pardon this offence,<br />
And eke accept thee to my grace again,<br />
But that I fear that, when I stand in need<br />
And want your help, you will your lord betray:<br />
How say you, Lælius, may I trust to thee?<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> Ay, noble lord, by all the gods I vow;<br />
For first shall heavens want stars, and foaming seas<br />
Want watery drops, before I'll traitor be<br />
Unto Alphonsus, whom I honour so.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Well then, arise; and for because I'll try<br />
[<span class="smcap">Lælius</span> <i>arises.</i><br />
If that thy words and deeds be both alike,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Go haste and fetch the youths of Arragon,<br />
Which now I hear have turn'd their heels and fled:<br />
Tell them your chance, and bring them back again<br />
Into this wood; where in ambushment lie,<br />
Until I send or come for you myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> I will, my lord.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Full little think Belinus and his peers<br />
What thoughts Alphonsus casteth in his mind;<br />
For if they did, they would not greatly haste<br />
To pay the same the which they promis'd me.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Belinus, Albinius, Fabius</span>, <i>with their</i> Soldiers,

<p>
<i>Beli.</i> Like simple sheep, when shepherd absent is<br />
Far from his flock, assail'd by greedy wolves,<br />
Do scattering fly about, some here, some there,<br />
To keep their bodies from their ravening jaws,<br />
So do the fearful youths of Arragon<br />
Run round about the green and pleasant plains,<br />
And hide their heads from Neapolitans;<br />
Such terror have their strong and sturdy blows<br />
Struck to their hearts, as for a world of gold,<br />
I warrant you, they will not come again.<br />
But, noble lords, where is the knight become<br />
Which made the blood be-sprinkle all the place<br />
Whereas he did encounter with his foe?<br />
My friend, Albinius, know you where he is?<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Not I, my lord, for since in thickest ranks<br />
I saw him chase Flaminius at the heels,<br />
I never yet could set mine eyes on him.<br />
But see, my lord, whereas the warrior stands,<br />
Or else my sight doth fail me at this time.<br />

<i>Beli.</i> 'Tis he indeed, who, as I do suppose,<br />
Hath slain the king, or else some other lord,<br />
For well I wot, a carcass I do see<br />
Hard at his feet lie struggling on the ground.<br />
Come on, Albinius, we will try the truth.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Belinus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>go towards</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
Hail to the noble victor of our foes!<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Thanks, mighty prince; but yet I seek not this:<br />
It is not words must recompense my pain,<br />
But deeds. When first I took up arms for you,<br />
Your promise was, whatever my sword did win<br />
In fight, as his Alphonsus should it crave.<br />
See, then, where lies thy foe Flaminius,<br />
Whose crown my sword hath conquer'd in the field;<br />
Therefore, Belinus, make no long delay,<br />
But that discharge you promis'd for to pay.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Will nothing else satisfy thy conquering mind<br />
Besides the crown? Well, since thou hast it won,<br />
Thou shalt it have, though far against my will.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span> <i>sits in the chair</i>; <span class="smcap">Belinus</span> <i>takes the
crown off</i> <span class="smcap">Flaminius</span>' <i>head, and puts it on that
of</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
Here doth Belinus crown thee with his hand<br />
The King of Arragon.<br />
[<i>Trumpets and drums sound within.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">What, are you pleas'd?</span><br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Not so, Belinus, till you promise me<br />
All things belonging to the royal crown<br />
Of Arragon, and make your lordings swear<br />
For to defend me to their utmost power<br />
Against all men that shall gainsay the same.<br />
<br />

Of Arragon, that challenge as thine own;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Belinus gives it frankly unto thee,<br />
And swears by all the powers of glittering skies<br />
To do my best for to maintain the same,<br />
So that it be not prejudicial<br />
Unto mine honour, or my country-soil.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> And by the sacred seat of mighty Jove<br />
Albinius swears that first he'll die the death,<br />
Before he'll see Alphonsus suffer wrong.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> What erst Albinius vow'd we jointly vow.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Thanks, mighty lords; but yet I greatly fear<br />
That very few will keep the oaths they swear.<br />
But, what, Belinus, why stand you so long,<br />
And cease from offering homage unto me?<br />
What, know you not that I thy sovereign am,<br />
Crownèd by thee and all thy other lords,<br />
And now confirmèd by your solemn oaths?<br />
Feed not thyself with fond persuasions,<br />
But presently come yield thy crown to me,<br />
And do me homage, or by heavens I swear<br />
I'll force thee to it maugre all thy train.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> How now, base brat! what, are thy wits thine own,<br />
That thou dar'st thus abraid<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> me in my land?<br />
'Tis best for thee these speeches to recall,<br />
Or else, by Jove, I'll make thee to repent<br />
That ere thou sett'st thy foot in Naples' soil.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> "Base brat," say'st thou? as good a man as thou:<br />
But say I came but of a base descent,<br />
My deeds shall make my glory for to shine<br />
As clear as Luna in a winter's night.<br />
But for because thou bragg'st so of thy birth,<br />
I'll see how it shall profit thee anon.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><i>Fabi.</i> Alphonsus, cease from these thy threatening words,<br />
And lay aside this thy presumptuous mind,<br />
Or else be sure thou shalt the same repent.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> How now, sir boy! will you be prattling too?<br />
'Tis best for thee to hold thy tattling tongue,<br />
Unless I send some one to scourge thy breech.<br />
Why, then, I see 'tis time to look about<br />
When every boy Alphonsus dares control:<br />
But be they sure, ere Phœbus' golden beams<br />
Have compassèd the circle of the sky,<br />
I'll clog their tongues, since nothing else will serve<br />
To keep those vilde<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and threatening speeches in.<br />
Farewell, Belinus, look thou to thyself:<br />
Alphonsus means to have thy crown ere night.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />

The fiends of hell torment his traitorous corpse!<br />
Is this the quittance of Belinus' grace,<br />
Which he did show unto that thankless wretch,<br />
That runagate, that rakehell, yea, that thief?<br />
For, well I wot, he hath robb'd me of a crown.<br />
If ever he had sprung from gentle blood,<br />
He would not thus misuse his favourer.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> "That runagate, that rakehell, yea, that thief"!<br />
Stay there, sir king, your mouth runs over-much;<br />
It ill becomes the subject for to use<br />
Such traitorous terms against his sovereign.<br />
Know thou, Belinus, that Carinus' son<br />
Is neither rakehell, [no], nor runagate.<br />
But be thou sure that, ere the darksome night<br />

I'll teach the slave to know to whom he speaks.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> To thee I speak, and to thy fellows all;<br />
And though as now you have me in your power,<br />
Yet doubt I not but that in little space<br />
These eyes shall see thy treason recompens'd,<br />
And then I mean to vaunt our victory.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Nay, proud Albinius, never build on that;<br />
For though the gods do chance for to appoint<br />
Alphonsus victor of Belinus' land,<br />
Yet shalt thou never live to see that day;&mdash;<br />
And therefore, Fabius, stand not lingering,<br />
But presently slash off his traitorous head.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Slash off his head! as though Albinius' head<br />
Were then so easy to be slashèd off:<br />
In faith, sir, no; when you are gone and dead,<br />
I hope to flourish like the pleasant spring.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Why, how now, Fabius! what, do you stand in doubt<br />
To do the deed? what fear you? who dares seek<br />
For to revenge his death on thee again,<br />

Now, Sir Albinius, are you of the mind<br />
That erst you were? what, do you look to see,<br />
And triumph in, Belinus' overthrow?<br />
I hope the very sight of this my blade<br />
Hath chang'd your mind into another tune.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Not so, Belinus, I am constant still;<br />
My mind is like to the asbeston-stone,<br />

Denieth to becomen cold again:<br />
Even so am I, and shall be till I die.<br />
And though I should see Atropos appear,<br />
With knife in hand, to slit my thread in twain,<br />
Yet ne'er Albinius should persuaded be<br />
But that Belinus he should vanquish'd see.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Nay, then, Albinius, since that words are vain<br />
For to persuade you from this heresy,<br />
This sword shall sure put you out of doubt.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Another Part of the Field.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lælius, Miles</span>, <i>and</i> Servants.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Læli.</i> My noble lords of Arragon, I know<br />
You wonder much what might the occasion be<br />
That Lælius, which erst did fly the field,<br />
Doth egg you forwards now unto the wars;<br />
But when you hear my reason, out of doubt<br />
You'll be content with this my rash attempt.<br />
When first our king, Flaminius I do mean,<br />
Did set upon the Neapolitans,<br />
The worst of you did know and plainly see<br />
How far they were unable to withstand<br />
The mighty forces of our royal camp,<br />
Until such time as froward fates we thought,&mdash;<br />
Although the fates ordain'd it for our gain,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Did send a stranger stout, whose sturdy blows<br />
And force alone did cause our overthrow.<br />
But to our purpose: this same martial knight<br />
Did hap to hit upon Flaminius,<br />
And lent our king then such a friendly blow<br />
As that his gasping ghost to Limbo went.<br />
Which when I saw, and seeking to revenge,<br />
My noble lords, did hap on such a prize<br />
As never king nor keisar got the like.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Lælius, of force we must confess to thee,<br />
We wonder'd all whenas you did persuade<br />
Us to return unto the wars again;<br />
But since our marvel is increasèd much<br />
By these your words, which sound of happiness:<br />
Therefore, good Lælius, make no tarrying,<br />
But soon unfold thy happy chance to us.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> Then, friends and fellow soldiers, hark to me;<br />
When Lælius thought for to revenge his king<br />
On that same knight, instead of mortal foe,<br />
I found him for to be our chiefest friend.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Our chiefest friend! I hardly can believe<br />
That he, which made such bloody massacres<br />
Of stout Italians, can in any point<br />
Bear friendship to the country or the king.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> As for your king, Miles, I hold with you,<br />
He bare no friendship to Flaminius,<br />
But hated him as bloody Atropos;<br />
But for your country, Lælius doth avow<br />
He loves as well as any other land,<br />
Yea, sure, he loves it best of all the world.<br />
And, for because you shall not think that I<br />
Do say the same without a reason why,<br />
Know that the knight Alphonsus hath to name,<br />
Both son and heir to old Carinus, whom<br />
Flaminius' sire bereavèd of his crown;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Who did not seek the ruin of our host<br />
For any envy he did bear to us,<br />
But to revenge him on his mortal foe;<br />
Which by the help of high celestial Jove<br />
He hath achiev'd with honour in the field.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Alphonsus, man! I'll ne'er persuaded be<br />
That e'er Alphonsus may survive again,<br />
Who with Carinus, many years ago,<br />
Was said to wander in the Stygian fields.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> Truth, noble Miles: these mine ears have heard,<br />
For certainty reported unto me,<br />
That old Carinus, with his peerless son,<br />
Had felt the sharpness of the Sisters' shears;<br />
And had I not of late Alphonsus seen<br />
In good estate, though all the world should say<br />
He is alive, I would not credit them.<br />
But, fellow soldiers, wend you back with me,<br />
And let us lurk within the secret shade<br />
Which he himself appointed unto us;<br />
And if you find my words to be untroth,<br />
Then let me die to recompense the wrong.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum: re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>with his sword drawn.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Albi.</i> Lælius, make haste: soldiers of Arragon,<br />
Set lingering by, and come and help your king,<br />
I mean Alphonsus, who, whilst that he did<br />
Pursue Belinus at the very heels,<br />
Was suddenly environèd about<br />
With all the troops of mighty Milan-land.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> What news is this! and is it very so?<br />
Is our Alphonsus yet in human state,<br />
Whom all the world did judge for to be dead?<br />
Yet can I scarce give credit to the same:<br />
Give credit! yes, and since the Milan Duke<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Hath broke his league of friendship, be he sure,<br />
Ere Cynthia, the shining lamp of night,<br />
Doth scale the heavens with her hornèd head,<br />
Both he and his shall very plainly see<br />
The league is burst that causèd long the glee.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> And could the traitor harbour in his breast<br />
Such mortal treason 'gainst his sovereign,<br />
As when he should with fire and sword defend<br />
Him from his foes, he seeks his overthrow?<br />
March on, my friends: I ne'er shall joy at all,<br />
Until I see that bloody traitor's fall.<br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD</h3>


<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p>
<i>Venus.</i> No sooner did Alphonsus with his troop<br />
Set on the soldiers of Belinus' band,<br />
But that the fury of his sturdy blows<br />
Did strike such terror to their daunted minds<br />
That glad was he which could escape away,<br />
With life and limb, forth of that bloody fray.<br />
Belinus flies unto the Turkish soil,<br />
To crave the aid of Amurack their king;<br />
Unto the which he willingly did consent,<br />
And sends Belinus, with two other kings,<br />
To know God Mahomet's pleasure in the same.<br />
Meantime the empress by Medea's help<br />
Did use such charms that Amurack did see,<br />
In soundest sleep, what afterward should hap.<br />
How Amurack did recompense her pain,<br />
With mickle more, this act shall show you plain.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter one, carrying two crowns upon a crest;</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus,
Albinius, Lælius</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span>, <i>with their</i> Soldiers.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Alphon.</i> Welcome, brave youths of Arragon, to me,<br />
Yea, welcome, Miles, Lælius, and the rest,<br />
Whose prowess alone hath been the only cause<br />
That we, like victors, have subdu'd our foes.<br />
Lord, what a pleasure was it to my mind,<br />
To see Belinus, which not long before<br />
Did with his threatenings terrify the gods,<br />
Now scud apace from warlike Lælius' blows.<br />
The Duke of Milan, he increas'd our sport,<br />
Who doubting that his force was over-weak<br />
For to withstand, Miles, thy sturdy arm,<br />
Did give more credence to his frisking skips<br />
Than to the sharpness of his cutting blade.<br />
What Fabius did to pleasure us withal,<br />
Albinius knows as well as I myself;<br />
For, well I wot, if that thy tirèd steed<br />
Had been as fresh and swift in foot as his,<br />
He should have felt, yea, known for certainty,<br />
To check Alphonsus did deserve to die.<br />
Briefly, my friends and fellow-peers in arms,<br />
The worst of you deserve such mickle praise,<br />
As that my tongue denies for to set forth<br />
The demi-parcel of your valiant deeds;<br />
So that, perforce, I must by duty be<br />
Bound to you all for this your courtesy.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Not so, my lord; for if our willing arms<br />
Have pleasur'd you so much as you do say,<br />
We have done naught but that becometh us,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>For to defend our mighty sovereign.<br />
As for my part, I count my labour small,<br />
Yea, though it had been twice as much again,<br />
Since that Alphonsus doth accept thereof.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Thanks, worthy Miles: lest all the world<br />
Should count Alphonsus thankless for to be,<br />
Lælius, sit down, and, Miles, sit by him,<br />
And that receive the which your swords have won.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Lælius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>sit down.</i><br />
First, for because thou, Lælius, in these broils,<br />
By martial might, didst proud Belinus chase<br />
From troop to troop, from side to side about,<br />
And never ceas'd from this thy swift pursuit<br />
Until thou hadst obtain'd his royal crown,<br />
Therefore, I say, I'll do thee naught but right,<br />
And give thee that which thou well hast won.<br />
[<i>Sets the crown on his head.</i><br />
Here doth Alphonsus crown thee, Lælius, King<br />
Of Naples' town, with all dominions<br />
That erst belongèd to our traitorous foe,<br />
That proud Belinus, in his regiment.<br />
[<i>Trumpets and drums sounded.</i><br />
Miles, thy share the Milan Dukedom is,<br />
For, well I wot, thy sword deserv'd no less;<br />
[<i>Sets the crown on his head.</i><br />
The which Alphonsus frankly giveth thee,<br />
In presence of his warlike men-at-arms;<br />
And if that any stomach<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> this my deed,<br />
Alphonsus can revenge thy wrong with speed.<br />
[<i>Trumpets and drums sounded.</i><br />
Now to Albinius, which in all my toils<br />
I have both faithful, yea, and friendly, found:<br />
Since that the gods and friendly fates assign<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>This present time to me to recompense<br />
The sundry pleasures thou hast done to me,<br />
Sit down by them, and on thy faithful head<br />
[<i>Takes the crown from his own head.</i><br />
Receive the crown of peerless Arragon.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Pardon, dear lord, Albinius at this time;<br />
It ill becomes me for to wear a crown<br />
Whenas my lord is destitute himself.<br />
Why, high Alphonsus, if I should receive<br />
This crown of you, the which high Jove forbid,<br />
Where would yourself obtain a diadem?<br />
Naples is gone, Milan possessèd is,<br />
And naught is left for you but Arragon.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> And naught is left for me but Arragon!<br />
Yes, surely, yes, my fates have so decreed,<br />
That Arragon should be too base a thing<br />
For to obtain Alphonsus for her king.<br />
What, hear you not how that our scatter'd foes,<br />
Belinus, Fabius, and the Milan duke,<br />
Are fled for succour to the Turkish court?<br />
And think you not that Amurack their king,<br />
Will, with the mightiest power of all his land,<br />
Seek to revenge Belinus' overthrow?<br />
Then doubt I not but, ere these broils do end,<br />
Alphonsus shall possess the diadem<br />
That Amurack now wears upon his head.<br />
Sit down therefóre, and that receive of me<br />
The which the fates appointed unto thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Thou King of Heaven, which by Thy power divine<br />
Dost see the secrets of each liver's heart,<br />
Bear record now with what unwilling mind<br />
I do receive the crown of Arragon.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>sits down by</i> <span class="smcap">Lælius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles;
Alphonsus</span> <i>sets the crown on his head.</i><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><i>Alphon.</i> Arise, Albinius, King of Arragon,<br />
Crownèd by me, who, till my gasping ghost<br />
Do part asunder from my breathless corpse,<br />
Will be thy shield against all men alive<br />
That for thy kingdom any way do strive.<br />
[<i>Trumpets and drums sounded.</i><br />
Now since we have, in such an happy hour,<br />
Confirm'd three kings, come, let us march with speed<br />
Into the city, for to celebrate<br />
With mirth and joy this blissful festival.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Amurack</span> <i>at Constantinople.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Amurack, Belinus, Fabius, Arcastus,
Claramont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bajazet</span>, <i>with their train.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Amu.</i> Welcome, Belinus, to thy cousin's court,<br />
Whose late arrival in such posting pace<br />
Doth bring both joy and sorrow to us all;<br />
Sorrow, because the fates have been so false<br />
To let Alphonsus drive thee from thy land,<br />
And joy, since that now mighty Mahomet<br />
Hath given me cause to recompense at full<br />
The sundry pleasures I receiv'd of thee.<br />
Therefore, Belinus, do but ask and have,<br />
For Amurack doth grant whate'er you crave.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Thou second sun, which with thy glimpsing beams<br />
Dost clarify each corner of the earth,<br />
Belinus comes not, as erst Midas did<br />
To mighty Bacchus, to desire of him<br />
That whatsoe'er at any time he touch'd<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Might turnèd be to gold incontinent.<br />
Nor do I come as Jupiter did erst<br />
Unto the palace of Amphitryon,<br />
For any fond or foul concupiscence<br />
Which I do bear to Alcumena's hue.<br />
But as poor Saturn, forc'd by mighty Jove<br />
To fly his country, banish'd and forlorn,<br />
Did crave the aid of Troos, King of Troy,<br />
So comes Belinus to high Amurack;<br />
And if he can but once your aid obtain,<br />
He turns with speed to Naples back again.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> My aid, Belinus! do you doubt of that?<br />
If all the men-at-arms of Africa,<br />
Of Asia likewise, will sufficient be<br />
To press the pomp of that usurping mate,<br />
Assure thyself, thy kingdom shall be thine,<br />
If Mahomet say ay unto the same;<br />
For were I sure to vanquish all our foes,<br />
And find such spoils in ransacking their tents<br />
As never any keisar did obtain,<br />
Yet would I not set foot forth of this land,<br />
If Mahomet our journey did withstand.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Nor would Belinus, for King Crœsus' trash,<br />
Wish Amurack to displease the gods,<br />
In pleasuring me in such a trifling toy.<br />
Then, mighty monarch, if it be thy will,<br />
Get their consents, and then the act fulfil.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> You counsel well; therefore, Belinus, haste,<br />
And, Claramont, go bear him company,<br />
With King Arcastus, to the city walls:<br />
Then bend with speed unto the darksome grove,<br />
Where Mahomet, this many a hundred year,<br />
Hath prophesied unto our ancestors.<br />
Tell to his priests that Amurack, your king,<br />
Is now selecting all his men-at-arms<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>To set upon that proud Alphonsus' troop:<br />
(The cause you know, and can inform them well,<br />
That makes me take these bloody broils in hand?)<br />
And say that I desire their sacred god,<br />
That Mahomet which ruleth all the skies,<br />
To send me word, and that most speedily,<br />
Which of us shall obtain the victory.<br />
[<i>Exeunt all except</i> <span class="smcap">Bajazet</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Amurack</span>.<br />
You, Bajazet, go post away apace<br />
To Syria, Scythia, and Albania,<br />
To Babylon, with Mesopotamia,<br />
Asia, Armenia, and all other lands<br />
Which owe their homage to high Amurack:<br />
Charge all their kings with expedition<br />
To gather up the chiefest men-at-arms<br />
Which now remain in their dominions,<br />
And on the twentieth day of the same month<br />
To come and wait on Amurack their king,<br />
At his chief city Constantinople.<br />
Tell them, moreover, that, whoso doth fail,<br />
Naught else but death from prison shall him bail.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>You seek to give our daughter to his hands?<br />
The gods forbid that such a heinous deed<br />
With my consent should ever be decreed:<br />
And rather than thou shouldst it bring to pass,<br />
If all the army of Amazones<br />
Will be sufficient to withhold the same,<br />
Assure thyself that Fausta means to fight<br />
'Gainst Amurack for to maintain the right.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> Yea, mother, say,&mdash;which Mahomet forbid,&mdash;<br />
That in this conflict you should have the foil,<br />
Ere that Alphonsus should be call'd my spouse,<br />
This heart, this hand, yea, and this blade, should be<br />
A readier means to finish that decree.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> [<i>rising in a rage</i>].<br />
What threatening words thus thunder in mine ears?<br />
Or who are they, amongst the mortal troops,<br />
That dare presume to use such threats to me?<br />
The proudest kings and keisars of the land<br />
Are glad to feed me in my fantasy;<br />
And shall I suffer, then, each prattling dame<br />
For to upbraid me in this spiteful sort?<br />
No, by the heavens, first will I lose my crown,<br />
My wife, my children, yea, my life and all.<br />
And therefore, Fausta, thou which Amurack<br />
Did tender erst, as the apple of mine eye,<br />
Avoid my court, and, if thou lov'st thy life,<br />
Approach not nigh unto my regiment.<br />
As for this carping girl, Iphigena,<br />
Take her with thee to bear thee company,<br />
And in my land I rede<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> be seen no more,<br />
For if you do, you both shall die therefóre. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> Nay, then, I see 'tis time to look about,<br />
Delay is dangerous, and procureth harm:<br />
The wanton colt is tamèd in his youth;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Wounds must be cur'd when they be fresh and green;<br />
And pleurisies, when they begin to breed,<br />
With little care are driven away with speed.<br />
Had Fausta then, when Amurack begun<br />
With spiteful speeches to control and check,<br />
Sought to prevent it by her martial force,<br />
This banishment had never hapt to me.<br />
But the echinus, fearing to be gor'd,<br />
Doth keep her younglings in her paunch so long,<br />
Till, when their pricks be waxen long and sharp,<br />
They put their dam at length to double pain:<br />
And I, because I loath'd the broils of Mars,<br />
Bridled my thoughts, and pressèd down my rage;<br />
In recompense of which my good intent<br />
I have receiv'd this woful banishment.<br />
Woful, said I? nay, happy I did mean,<br />
If that be happy which doth set one free;<br />
For by this means I do not doubt ere long<br />
But Fausta shall with ease revenge her wrong.<br />
Come, daughter, come: my mind foretelleth me<br />
That Amurack shall soon requited be.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Fausta</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Iphigena</span> <i>discovered; enter</i> <span class="smcap">Medea</span>,

<p>
<i>Medea.</i> Fausta, what means this sudden flight of yours?<br />
Why do you leave your husband's princely court,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>And all alone pass through these thickest groves,<br />
More fit to harbour brutish savage beasts<br />
Than to receive so high a queen as you?<br />
Although your credit would not stay your steps<br />
From bending them into these darkish dens,<br />
Yet should the danger, which is imminent<br />
To every one which passeth by these paths,<br />
Keep you at home with fair Iphigena.<br />
What foolish toy hath tickled you to this?<br />
I greatly fear some hap hath hit amiss.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> No toy, Medea, tickled Fausta's head,<br />
Nor foolish fancy led me to these groves,<br />
But earnest business eggs my trembling steps<br />
To pass all dangers, whatsoe'er they be.<br />
I banish'd am, Medea, I, which erst<br />
Was empress over all the triple world,<br />
Am banish'd now from palace and from pomp.<br />
But if the gods be favourers to me,<br />
Ere twenty days I will revengèd be.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> I thought as much, when first from thickest leaves<br />
I saw you trudging in such posting pace.<br />
But to the purpose: what may be the cause<br />
Of this strange and sudden banishment?<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> The cause, ask you? A simple cause, God wot;<br />
'Twas neither treason, nor yet felony,<br />
But for because I blam'd his foolishness.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> I hear you say so, but I greatly fear,<br />
Ere that your tale be brought unto an end,<br />
You'll prove yourself the author of the same.<br />
But pray, be brief; what folly did your spouse?<br />
And how will you revenge your wrong on him?<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> What folly, quoth you? Such as never yet<br />
Was heard or seen, since Phœbus first 'gan shine.<br />
You know how he was gathering in all haste<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>His men-at-arms, to set upon the troop<br />
Of proud Alphonsus; yea, you well do know<br />
How you and I did do the best we could<br />
To make him show us in his drowsy dream<br />
What afterward should happen in his wars.<br />
Much talk he had, which now I have forgot;<br />
But at the length this surely was decreed,<br />
How that Alphonsus and Iphigena<br />
Should be conjoin'd in Juno's sacred rites.<br />
Which when I heard, as one that did despise<br />
That such a traitor should be son to me,<br />
I did rebuke my husband Amurack:<br />
And since my words could take no better place,<br />
My sword with help of all Amazones<br />
Shall make him soon repent his foolishness.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> This is the cause, then, of your banishment?<br />
And now you go unto Amazone<br />
To gather all your maidens in array,<br />
To set upon the mighty Amurack?<br />
O foolish queen, what meant you by this talk?<br />
Those prattling speeches have undone you all.<br />
Do you disdain to have that mighty prince,<br />
I mean Alphonsus, counted for your son?<br />
I tell you, Fausta, he is born to be<br />
The ruler of a mighty monarchy.<br />
I must confess the powers of Amurack<br />
Be great; his confines stretch both far and near;<br />
Yet are they not the third part of the lands<br />
Which shall be rulèd by Alphonsus' hands:<br />
And yet you dain to call him son-in-law.<br />
But when you see his sharp and cutting sword<br />
Piercing the heart of this your gallant girl,<br />
You'll curse the hour wherein you did denay<br />
To join Alphonsus with Iphigena.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> The gods forbid that e'er it happen so!<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><i>Medea.</i> Nay, never pray, for it must happen so.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> And is there, then, no remedy for it?<br />
<br />
<i>Medea,</i> No, none but one, and that you have forsworn.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> As though an oath can bridle so my mind<br />
As that I dare not break a thousand oaths<br />
For to eschew the danger imminent!<br />
Speak, good Medea, tell that way to me,<br />
And I will do it, whatsoe'er it be.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> Then, as already you have well decreed,<br />
Pack to your country, and in readiness<br />
Select the army of Amazones:<br />
When you have done, march with your female troop<br />
To Naples' town, to succour Amurack:<br />
And so, by marriage of Iphigena,<br />
You soon shall drive the danger clean away.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> So shall we soon eschew Charybdis' lake,<br />
And headlong fall to Scylla's greedy gulf.<br />
I vow'd before, and now do vow again,<br />
Before I wed Alphonsus, I'll be slain.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> In vain it is to strive against the stream;<br />
Fates must be follow'd, and the gods' decree<br />
Must needs take place in every kind of cause.<br />
Therefore, fair maid, bridle these brutish thoughts,<br />
And learn to follow what the fates assign.<br />
When Saturn heard that Jupiter his son<br />
Should drive him headlong from his heavenly seat<br />
Down to the bottom of the dark Avern,<br />
He did command his mother presently<br />
To do to death the young and guiltless child:<br />
But what of that? the mother loath'd in heart<br />
For to commit so vile a massacre;<br />
Yea, Jove did live, and, as the fates did say,<br />
From heavenly seat drave Saturn clean away.<br />
What did avail the castle all of steel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>The which Acrisius causèd to be made<br />
To keep his daughter Danaë clogg'd in?<br />
She was with child for all her castle's force;<br />
And by that child Acrisius, her sire,<br />
Was after slain, so did the fates require.<br />
A thousand examples I could bring hereof;<br />
But marble stones need no colouring,<br />
And that which every one doth know for truth<br />
Needs no examples to confirm the same.<br />
That which the fates appoint must happen so,<br />
Though heavenly Jove and all the gods say no.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> Iphigena, she sayeth naught but truth;<br />
Fates must be follow'd in their just decrees;<br />
And therefore, setting all delays aside,<br />
Come, let us wend unto Amazone,<br />
And gather up our forces out of hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> Since Fausta wills and fates do so command,<br />
Iphigena will never it withstand.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH</h3>


<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Venus.</i> Thus have you seen how Amurack himself,<br />
Fausta his wife, and every other king<br />
Which hold their sceptres at the Turk his hands,<br />
Are now in arms, intending to destroy,<br />
And bring to naught, the Prince of Arragon.<br />
Charms have been us'd by wise Medea's art,<br />
To know before what afterward shall hap;<br />
And King Belinus, with high Claramont,<br />
Join'd to Arcastus, which with princely pomp<br />
Doth rule and govern all the warlike Moors,<br />
Are sent as legates to God Mahomet,<br />
To know his counsel in these high affairs.<br />
Mahound, provok'd by Amurack's discourse,<br />
Which, as you heard, he in his dream did use,<br />
Denies to play the prophet any more;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>But, by the long entreaty of his priests,<br />
He prophesies in such a crafty sort<br />
As that the hearers needs must laugh for sport.<br />
Yet poor Belinus, with his fellow kings,<br />
Did give such credence to that forgèd tale<br />
As that they lost their dearest lives thereby,<br />
And Amurack became a prisoner<br />
Unto Alphonsus, as straight shall appear.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Let there be a Brazen Head set in the middle of the place
behind the stage, out of the which cast flames of fire;

<p>
<i>First Pr.</i> My fellow priest of Mahound's holy house,<br />
What can you judge of these strange miracles<br />
Which daily happen in this sacred seat?<br />
[<i>Drums rumble within.</i><br />
Hark, what a rumbling rattleth in our ears!<br />
[<i>Flames of fire are cast forth of the Brazen Head.</i><br />
See flakes of fire proceeding from the mouth<br />
Of Mahomet, that god of peerless power!<br />
Nor can I tell, with all the wit I have,<br />
What Mahomet, by these his signs, doth crave.<br />
<br />
<i>Sec. Pr.</i> Thrice ten times Phœbus with his golden beams<br />
Hath compassèd the circle of the sky,<br />
Thrice ten times Ceres hath her workmen hir'd,<br />
And fill'd her barns with fruitful crops of corn,<br />
Since first in priesthood I did lead my life;<br />
Yet in this time I never heard before<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Such fearful sounds, nor saw such wondrous sights;<br />
Nor can I tell, with all the wit I have,<br />
What Mahomet, by these his signs, doth crave.<br />
<br />
<i>Mahomet</i> [<i>speaking out of the Brazen Head</i>].<br />
You cannot tell, nor will you seek to know:<br />
O perverse priests, how careless are you wax'd,<br />
As when my foes approach unto my gates,<br />
You stand still talking of "I cannot tell!"<br />
Go pack you hence, and meet the Turkish kings<br />
Which now are drawing to my temple ward;<br />
Tell them from me, God Mahomet is dispos'd<br />
To prophesy no more to Amurack,<br />
Since that his tongue is waxen now so free,<br />
As that it needs must chat and rail at me.<br />
[<i>The</i> Priests <i>kneel.</i><br />
<br />
<i>First Pr.</i> O Mahomet, if all the solemn prayers<br />
Which from our childhood we have offer'd thee,<br />
Can make thee call this sentence back again,<br />
Bring not thy priests into this dangerous state!<br />
For when the Turk doth hear of this repulse,<br />
We shall be sure to die the death therefóre.<br />
<br />
<i>Mahomet</i> [<i>speaking out of the Brazen Head</i>].<br />
Thou sayest truth; go call the princes in:<br />
I'll prophesy unto them for this once;<br />
But in such wise as they shall neither boast,<br />
Nor you be hurt in any kind of wise.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Belinus, Claramont, Arcastus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fabius</span>,
<i>conducted by the</i> Priests.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>First Pr.</i> You kings of Turkey, Mahomet our god,<br />
By sacred science having notice that<br />
You were sent legates from high Amurack<br />
Unto this place, commanded us, his priests,<br />
That we should cause you make as mickle speed<br />
As well you might, to hear for certainty<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Of that shall happen to your king and ye.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> For that intent we came into this place;<br />
And sithens that the mighty Mahomet<br />
Is now at leisure for to tell the same,<br />
Let us make haste and take time while we may,<br />
For mickle danger happeneth through delay.<br />
<br />
<i>Sec. Pr.</i> Truth, worthy king, and therefore you yourself,<br />
With your companions, kneel before this place,<br />
And listen well what Mahomet doth say.<br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> As you do will, we jointly will obey.<br />
[<i>All kneel down before the Brazen Head.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mahomet</i> [<i>speaking out of the Brazen Head</i>].<br />
Princes of Turkey, and ambassadors<br />
Of Amurack to mighty Mahomet,<br />
I needs must muse that you, which erst have been<br />
The readiest soldiers of the triple world,<br />
Are now become so slack in your affairs<br />
As, when you should with bloody blade in hand<br />
Be hacking helms in thickest of your foes,<br />
You stand still loitering in the Turkish soil.<br />
What, know you not how that it is decreed<br />
By all the gods, and chiefly by myself,<br />
That you with triumph should all crownèd be?<br />
Make haste, kings, lest when the fates do see<br />
How carelessly you do neglect their words,<br />
They call a council, and force Mahomet<br />
Against his will some other things to set.<br />
Send Fabius back to Amurack again,<br />
To haste him forwards in his enterprise;<br />
And march you on, with all the troops you have,<br />
To Naples ward, to conquer Arragon,<br />
For if you stay, both you and all your men<br />
Must needs be sent down straight to Limbo-den.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><i>Sec. Pr.</i> Muse not, brave kings, at Mahomet's discourse,<br />
For mark what he forth of that mouth doth say,<br />
Assure yourselves it needs must happen so.<br />
Therefore make haste, go mount you on your steeds,<br />
And set upon Alphonsus presently:<br />
So shall you reap great honour for your pain,<br />
And 'scape the scourge which else the fates ordain.<br />
[<i>All rise up.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Beli.</i> Then, proud Alphonsus, look thou to thy crown:<br />
Belinus comes, in glittering armour clad,<br />
All ready prest<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> for to revenge the wrong<br />
Which, not long since, you offer'd unto him;<br />
And since we have God Mahound on our side,<br />
The victory must needs to us betide.<br />
<br />
<i>Cla.</i> Worthy Belinus, set such threats away,<br />
And let us haste as fast as horse can trot<br />
To set upon presumptuous Arragon.&mdash;<br />
You, Fabius, haste, as Mahound did command,<br />
To Amurack with all the speed you may.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> With willing mind I hasten on my way.<br />

Belinus hastes to quail Alphonsus' might. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Near Naples.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum awhile. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carinus</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cari.</i> No sooner had God Phœbus' brightsome beams<br />
Begun to dive within the western seas,<br />
And darksome Nox had spread about the earth<br />
Her blackish mantle, but a drowsy sleep<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Did take possession of Carinus' sense,<br />
And Morpheus show'd me strange disguisèd shapes.<br />
Methought I saw Alphonsus, my dear son,<br />
Plac'd in a throne all glittering clear with gold,<br />
Bedeck'd with diamonds, pearls, and precious stones,<br />
Which shin'd so clear, and glitter'd all so bright,<br />
Hyperion's coach that well be term'd it might.<br />
Above his head a canopy was set,<br />
Not deck'd with plumes, as other princes use,<br />
But all beset with heads of conquer'd kings,<br />
Enstall'd with crowns, which made a gallant show,<br />
And struck a terror to the viewers' hearts.<br />
Under his feet lay grovelling on the ground<br />
Thousands of princes, which he in his wars<br />
By martial might did conquer and bring low:<br />
Some lay as dead as either stock or stone,<br />
Some other tumbled, wounded to the death;<br />
But most of them, as to their sovereign king,<br />
Did offer duly homage unto him.<br />
As thus I stood beholding of this pomp,<br />
Methought Alphonsus did espy me out,<br />
And, at a trice, he leaving throne alone,<br />
Came to embrace me in his blessèd arms.<br />
Then noise of drums and sound of trumpets shrill<br />
Did wake Carinus from this pleasant dream.<br />
Something, I know, is now foreshown by this:<br />
The gods forfend that aught should hap amiss!<br />
[<span class="smcap">Carinus</span> <i>walks up and down.</i><br />

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke of Milan</span> <i>in pilgrim's apparel.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Duke of M.</i> This is the chance of fickle Fortune's wheel;<br />
A prince at morn, a pilgrim ere't be night;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>I, which erewhile did dain for to possess<br />
The proudest palace of the western world,<br />
Would now be glad a cottage for to find,<br />
To hide my head; so Fortune hath assign'd.<br />
Thrice Hesperus with pomp and peerless pride<br />
Hath heav'd his head forth of the eastern seas,<br />
Thrice Cynthia, with Phœbus' borrow'd beams,<br />
Hath shown her beauty through the darkish clouds,<br />
Since that I, wretched duke, have tasted aught,<br />
Or drunk a drop of any kind of drink.<br />
Instead of beds set forth with ebony,<br />
The greenish grass hath been my resting-place,<br />
And for my pillow stuff'd with down,<br />
The hardish hillocks have suffic'd my turn.<br />
Thus I, which erst had all things at my will,<br />
A life more hard then death do follow still.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Methinks I hear, not very far from hence,<br />
Some woful wight lamenting his mischance:<br />
I'll go and see if that I can espy<br />
Him where he sits, or overhear his talk.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> O Milan, Milan, little dost thou think,<br />
How that thy duke is now in such distress!<br />
For if thou didst, I soon should be releas'd<br />
Forth of this greedy gulf of misery.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. The Milan Duke! I thought as much before,<br />
When first I glanc'd mine eyes upon his face.<br />
This is the man which was the only cause<br />
That I was forc'd to fly from Arragon.<br />
High Jove be prais'd which hath allotted me<br />
So fit a time to quite that injury.&mdash;<br />
Pilgrim, God speed.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> Welcome, grave sir, to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Methought as now I heard you for to speak<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Of Milan-land: pray, do you know the same?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> Ay, aged father, I have cause to know<br />
Both Milan-land and all the parts thereof.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Why, then, I doubt not but you can resolve<br />
Me of a question that I shall demand.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> Ay, that I can, whatever that it be.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Then, to be brief: not twenty winters past,<br />
When these my limbs, which wither'd are with age,<br />
Were in the prime and spring of all their youth,<br />
I, still desirous, as young gallants be,<br />
To see the fashions of Arabia,<br />
My native soil, and in this pilgrim's weed,<br />
Began to travel through unkennèd lands.<br />
Much ground I pass'd, and many soils I saw;<br />
But when my feet in Milan-land I set,<br />
Such sumptuous triumphs daily there I saw<br />
As never in my life I found the like.<br />
I pray, good sir, what might the occasion be,<br />
That made the Milans make such mirth and glee?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> This solemn joy whereof you now do speak,<br />
Was not solémnisèd, my friend, in vain;<br />
For at that time there came into the land<br />
The happiest tidings that they e'er did hear;<br />
For news was brought upon that solemn day<br />
Unto our court, that Ferdinandus proud<br />
Was slain himself, Carinus and his son<br />
Was banish'd both for e'er from Arragon;<br />
And for these happy news that joy was made.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> But what, I pray, did afterward become<br />
Of old Carinus with his banish'd son?<br />
What, hear you nothing of them all this while?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke of M.</i> Yes, too-too much, the Milan Duke may say.<br />
Alphonsus first by secret means did get<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>To be a soldier in Belinus' wars,<br />
Wherein he did behave himself so well<br />
As that he got the crown of Arragon;<br />
Which being got, he dispossess'd also<br />
The King Belinus which had foster'd him.<br />
As for Carinus he is dead and gone:<br />
I would his son were his companion.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> A blister build upon that traitor's tongue!<br />
But, for thy friendship which thou showed'st me,<br />
Take that of me, I frankly give it thee.<br />
[<i>Stabs the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke of Milan</span>, <i>who dies.</i><br />
Now will I haste to Naples with all speed,<br />
To see if Fortune will so favour me<br />
To view Alphonsus in his happy state.<br />

<p>
<i>Amu.</i> Fabius, come hither: what is that thou sayest?<br />
What did God Mahound prophesy to us?<br />
Why do our viceroys wend unto the wars<br />
Before their king had notice of the same?<br />
What, do they think to play bob-fool with me?<br />
Or are they wax'd so frolic now of late,<br />
Since that they had the leading of our bands,<br />
As that they think that mighty Amurack<br />
Dares do no other than to soothe them up?<br />
Why speak'st thou not? what fond or frantic fit<br />
Did make those careless kings to venture it?<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> Pardon, dear lord; no frantic fit at all,<br />
No frolic vein, nor no presumptuous mind,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Did make your viceroys take these wars in hand:<br />
But forc'd they were by Mahound's prophecy<br />
To do the same, or else resolve to die.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> So, sir, I hear you, but can scarce believe<br />
That Mahomet would charge them go before,<br />
Against Alphonsus with so small a troop,<br />
Whose number far exceeds King Xerxes' troop.<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> Yes, noble lord, and more than that, he said<br />
That, ere that you, with these your warlike men,<br />
Should come to bring your succour to the field,<br />
Belinus, Claramont, and Arcastus too<br />
Should all be crown'd with crowns of beaten gold,<br />
And borne with triumph round about their tents.<br />
<br />

Till Amurack discharge him from the same;<br />
For be he sure, unless it happen so<br />
As he did say Mahound did prophesy,<br />
By this my hand forthwith the slave shall die.<br />
[<i>They lay hold of</i> <span class="smcap">Fabius</span>, <i>and make as though to

<p><i>Enter a</i> Messenger.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Mess.</i> Stay, Provost, stay, let Fabius alone:<br />
More fitteth now that every lusty lad<br />
Be buckling on his helmet, than to stand<br />
In carrying soldiers to the Marshalsea.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> Why, what art thou, that darest once presume<br />
For to gainsay that Amurack did bid?<br />
<br />
<i>Mess.</i> I am, my lord, the wretched'st man alive,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Born underneath the planet of mishap;<br />
Erewhile, a soldier of Belinus' band,<br />

<br />

Whose captain's slain, and all his army dead,<br />
Only excepted me, unhappy wretch.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> What news is this! and is Belinus slain?<br />
Is this the crown which Mahomet did say<br />
He should with triumph wear upon his head?<br />
Is this the honour which that cursèd god<br />
Did prophesy should happen to them all?<br />
O Dædalus, an wert thou now alive,<br />
To fasten wings upon high Amurack,<br />
Mahound should know, and that for certainty,<br />
That Turkish kings can brook no injury!<br />
<br />
<i>Fabi.</i> Tush, tush, my lord; I wonder what you mean,<br />
Thus to exclaim against high Mahomet:<br />
I'll lay my life that, ere this day be past,<br />
You shall perceive his tidings all be waste.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> We shall perceive, accursèd Fabius!<br />
Suffice it not that thou hast been the man<br />
That first didst beat those baubles in my brain,<br />
But that, to help me forward in my grief,<br />
Thou seekest to confirm so foul a lie?<br />
Go, get thee hence, and tell thy traitorous king<br />
What gift you had, which did such tidings bring.&mdash;<br />
[<i>Stabs</i> <span class="smcap">Fabius</span>, <i>who dies.</i><br />
And now, my lords, since nothing else will serve,<br />
Buckle your helms, clap on your steelèd coats,<br />
Mount on your steeds, take lances in your hands;<br />
For Amurack doth mean this very day<br />
Proud Mahomet with weapons to assay.<br />
<br />
<i>Mess.</i> Mercy, high monarch! it is no time now<br />
To spend the day in such vain threatenings<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Against our god, the mighty Mahomet:<br />
More fitteth thee to place thy men-at-arms<br />
In battle 'ray, for to withstand your foes,<br />
Which now are drawing towards you with speed.<br />
[<i>Drums sounded within.</i><br />
Hark, how their drums with dub-a-dub do come!<br />
To arms, high lord, and set these trifles by,<br />
That you may set upon them valiantly.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> And do they come? you kings of Turkey-[land],<br />
Now is the time in which your warlike arms<br />
Must raise your names above the starry skies.<br />
Call to your mind your predecessors' acts,<br />
Whose martial might, this many a hundred year,<br />
Did keep those fearful dogs in dread and awe,<br />
And let your weapons show Alphonsus plain,<br />
That though that they be clappèd up in clay,<br />
Yet there be branches sprung up from those trees,<br />
In Turkish land, which brook no injuries.<br />
Besides the same, remember with yourselves<br />
What foes we have; not mighty Tamburlaine,<br />
Nor soldiers trainèd up amongst the wars,<br />
But fearful boors, pick'd from their rural flock,<br />
Which, till this time, were wholly ignorant<br />
What weapons meant, or bloody Mars doth crave.<br />
More would I say, but horses that be free<br />
Do need no spurs, and soldiers which themselves<br />
Long and desire to buckle with the foe,<br />
Do need no words to egg them to the same.<br />

Courage, my lords, ours is the victory.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Thou pagan dog, how dar'st thou be so bold<br />
To set thy foot within Alphonsus' land?<br />
What, art thou come to view thy wretched kings,<br />
Whose traitorous heads bedeck my tent so well?<br />
Or else, thou hearing that on top thereof<br />
There is a place left vacant, art thou come<br />
To have thy head possess the highest seat?<br />
If it be so, lie down, and this my sword<br />
Shall presently that honour thee afford.<br />
If not, pack hence, or by the heavens I vow,<br />
Both thou and thine shall very soon perceive<br />
That he that seeks to move my patience<br />
Must yield his life to me for recompense.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> Why, proud Alphonsus, think'st thou Amurack,<br />
Whose mighty force doth terrify the gods,<br />
Can e'er be found to turn his heels, and fly<br />
Away for fear from such a boy as thou?<br />
No, no, although that Mars this mickle while<br />
Hath fortified thy weak and feeble arm,<br />
And Fortune oft hath view'd with friendly face<br />
Thy armies marching victors from the field,<br />
Yet at the presence of high Amurack<br />
Fortune shall change, and Mars, that god of might,<br />
Shall succour me, and leave Alphonsus quite.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Pagan, I say thou greatly art deceiv'd:<br />
I clap up Fortune in a cage of gold,<br />
To make her turn her wheel as I think best;<br />
And as for Mars whom you do say will change,<br />
He moping sits behind the kitchen-door,<br />
Prest at command of every scullion's mouth,<br />
Who dares not stir, nor once to move a whit,<br />
For fear Alphonsus then should stomach it.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> Blasp-hém-ous dog, I wonder that the earth<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Doth cease from renting underneath thy feet,<br />
To swallow up that canker'd corpse of thine.<br />
I muse that Jove can bridle so his ire<br />
As, when he hears his brother so misus'd,<br />
He can refrain from sending thunderbolts<br />
By thick and threefold, to revenge his wrong.<br />
Mars fight for me, and fortune be my guide!<br />
And I'll be victor, whatsome'er betide.<br />
<br />
<i>Albi.</i> Pray loud enough,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> lest that you pray in vain:<br />
Perhaps God Mars and Fortune are asleep.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> An Mars lies slumbering on his downy bed,<br />
Yet do not think but that the power we have,<br />
Without the help of those celestial gods,<br />
Will be sufficient, yea, with small ado,<br />
Alphonsus' straggling army to subdue.<br />
<br />
<i>Læli.</i> You had need as then to call for Mahomet,<br />
With hellish hags to perform the same.<br />
<br />
<i>Faustus.</i> High Amurack, I wonder what you mean,<br />
That, when you may, with little toil or none,<br />
Compel these dogs to keep their tongues in peace,<br />
You let them stand still barking in this sort:<br />
Believe me, sovereign, I do blush to see<br />
These beggar's brats to chat so frolicly.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> How now, sir boy! Let Amurack himself,<br />
Or any he, the proudest of you all,<br />
But offer once for to unsheath his sword,<br />
If that he dares, for all the power you have.<br />

<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Venus.</i> Fierce is the fight, and bloody is the broil.<br />
No sooner had the roaring cannon shot<br />
Spit forth the venom of their firèd paunch,<br />
And with their pellets sent such troops of souls<br />
Down to the bottom of the dark Avern,<br />
As that it cover'd all the Stygian fields;<br />
But, on a sudden, all the men-at-arms,<br />
Which mounted were on lusty coursers' backs,<br />
Did rush together with so great a noise<br />
As that I thought the giants one time more<br />
Did scale the heavens, as erst they did before.<br />
Long time dame Fortune temper'd so her wheel<br />
As that there was no vantage to be seen<br />
On any side, but equal was the gain;<br />
But at the length, so God and Fates decreed,<br />
Alphonsus was the victor of the field,<br />
And Amurack became his prisoner;<br />
Who so remain'd, until his daughter came,<br />
And by her marrying did his pardon frame. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p>
<i>Fausta.</i> You Turkish kings, what sudden flight is this?<br />
What mean the men, which for their valiant prowess<br />
Were dreaded erst clean through the triple world,<br />
Thus cowardly to turn their backs and fly?<br />
What froward fortune happen'd on your side?<br />
I hope your king in safety doth abide?<br />
<br />
<i>Cro.</i> Ay, noble madam, Amurack doth live,<br />
And long I hope he shall enjoy his life;<br />
But yet I fear, unless more succour come,<br />
We shall both lose our king and sovereign.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> How so, King Crocon? dost thou speak in jest,<br />
To prove if Fausta would lament his death?<br />
Or else hath anything hapt him amiss?<br />
Speak quickly, Crocon, what the cause might be,<br />
That thou dost utter forth these words to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Cro.</i> Then, worthy Fausta, know that Amurack<br />
Our mighty king, and your approvèd spouse,<br />
Prick'd with desire of everlasting fame,<br />
As he was pressing in the thickest ranks<br />
Of Arragonians, was, with much ado,<br />
At length took prisoner by Alphonsus' hands.<br />
So that, unless you succour soon do bring,<br />
You lose your spouse, and we shall want our king.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> O hapless hap, O dire and cruel fate!<br />
What injury hath Amurack, my sire,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Done to the gods, which now I know are wroth,<br />
Although unjustly and without a cause?<br />
For well I wot, not any other king,<br />
Which now doth live, or since the world begun<br />
Did sway a sceptre, had a greater care<br />
To please the gods than mighty Amurack:<br />
And for to quite our father's great good-will,<br />
Seek they thus basely all his fame to spill?<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> Iphigena, leave off these woful tunes:<br />
It is not words can cure and case this wound,<br />
But warlike swords; not tears, but sturdy spears.<br />
High Amurack is prisoner to our foes:<br />
What then? Think you that our Amazones,<br />
Join'd with the forces of the Turkish troop,<br />
Are not sufficient for to set him free?<br />
Yes, daughter, yes, I mean not for to sleep<br />
Until he is free, or we him company keep.&mdash;<br />

Could meet your equal in the feats of arms,<br />
How haps it now that in such sudden sort<br />
You fly the presence of a silly maid?<br />
What, have you found mine arm of such a force<br />

For to withstand the fury of my blows?<br />
Or do you else disdain to fight with me,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>For staining of your high nobility?<br />

<i>Alphon.</i> No, dainty dame, I would not have thee think<br />
That ever thou or any other wight<br />
Shall live to see Alphonsus fly the field<br />
From any king or keisar whosome'er:<br />
First will I die in thickest of my foe,<br />
Before I will disbase mine honour so.<br />
Nor do I scorn, thou goddess, for to stain<br />
My prowess with thee, although it be a shame<br />
For knights to combat with the female sect:<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a><br />
But love, sweet mouse, hath so benumbed my wit,<br />
That, though I would, I must refrain from it.<br />

Your noble acts were fitter to be writ<br />
Within the tables of Dame Venus' son,<br />
Than in God Mars his warlike registers:<br />
Whenas your lords are hacking helms abroad,<br />
And make their spears to shiver in the air,<br />
Your mind is busied in fond Cupid's toys.<br />
Come on, i' faith, I'll teach you for to know<br />
We came to fight, and not to love, I trow.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i>  Nay, virgin, stay. An if thou wilt vouchsafe<br />
To entertain Alphonsus' simple suit,<br />
Thou shalt ere long be monarch of the world:<br />
All christen'd kings, with all your pagan dogs,<br />
Shall bend their knees unto Iphigena;<br />
The Indian soil shall be thine at command,<br />
Where every step thou settest on the ground<br />

That fame or riches can so rule my thoughts<br />
As for to make me love and fancy him<br />
Whom I do hate, and in such sort despise,<br />
As, if my death could bring to pass his bane,<br />
I would not long from Pluto's port remain.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Nay, then, proud peacock, since thou art so stout<br />
As that entreaty will not move thy mind<br />
For to consent to be my wedded spouse,<br />
Thou shalt, in spite of gods and fortune too,<br />

<p>
<i>Medea.</i> Nay, Amurack, this is no time to jar:<br />
Although thy wife did, in her frantic mood,<br />
Use speeches which might better have been spar'd,<br />
Yet do thou not judge this same time to be<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>A season to requite that injury.<br />
More fitteth thee, with all the wit thou hast,<br />
To call to mind which way thou mayst release<br />
Thyself, thy wife, and fair Iphigena,<br />
Forth of the power of stout Alphonsus' hands;<br />
For, well I wot, since first you breathèd breath,<br />
You never were so nigh the snares of death.<br />
Now, Amurack, your high and kingly seat,<br />
Your royal sceptre, and your stately crown,<br />
Your mighty country, and your men-at-arms,<br />
Be conquer'd all, and can no succour bring.<br />
Put, then, no trust in these same paltry toys,<br />
But call to mind that thou a prisoner art,<br />
Clapt up in chains, whose life and death depend<br />
Upon the hands of thy most mortal foe.<br />
Then take thou heed, that whatsome'er he say,<br />
Thou dost not once presume for to gainsay.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> Away, you fool! think you your cursèd charms<br />
Can bridle so the mind of Amurack<br />
As that he will stand crouching to his foe?<br />
No, no, be sure that, if that beggar's brat<br />
Do dare but once to contrary my will,<br />
I'll make him soon in heart for to repent<br />
That e'er such words 'gainst Amurack he spent.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> Then, since thou dost disdain my good advice,<br />
Look to thyself, and if you fare amiss,<br />
Remember that Medea counsel gave,<br />
Which might you safe from all those perils save.<br />
But, Fausta, you, as well you have begun,<br />
Beware you follow still your friend's advice:<br />
If that Alphonsus do desire of thee<br />
To have your daughter for his wedded spouse,<br />
Beware you do not once the same gainsay,<br />
Unless with death he do your rashness pay.<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> No, worthy wight; first Fausta means to die<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Before Alphonsus she will contrary.<br />
<br />
<i>Medea.</i> Why, then, farewell.&mdash;But you, Iphigena,<br />
Beware you do not over-squeamish wax,<br />
Whenas your mother giveth her consent.<br />

That which Medea bids me to obey. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Medea</span>.<br />

Against God Mars, and fickle Fortune's wheel,<br />
Have got the goal for all your solemn prayers.<br />
Yourself are prisoner, which as then did think<br />
That all the forces of the triple world<br />
Were insufficient to fulfil the same.<br />
How like you this? Is Fortune of such might,<br />
Or hath God Mars such force or power divine,<br />
As that he can, with all the power he hath,<br />
Set thee and thine forth of Alphonsus' hands?<br />
I do not think but that your hope's so small<br />
As that you would with very willing mind<br />
Yield for my spouse the fair Iphigena,<br />
On that condition, that without delay<br />
Fausta and you may scot-free 'scape away.<br />

<i>Amu.</i> What, think'st thou, villain, that high Amurack<br />
Bears such a mind as, for the fear of death,<br />
He'll yield his daughter, yea, his only joy,<br />

No, traitor, no; for [though] as now I lie<br />

Shall with your lives requite that injury.&mdash;<br />

That is their daughter, fair Iphigena;<br />
Both which, together with the Turk himself,<br />
He did take prisoners in a battle fought.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> [<i>spying out</i> <span class="smcap">Carinus</span>].<br />
And can the gods be found so kind to me<br />
As that Carinus now I do espy?<br />
'Tis he indeed.&mdash;Come on, Albinius:<br />
The mighty conquest which I have achiev'd,<br />
And victories the which I oft have won,<br />
Bring not such pleasure to Alphonsus' heart<br />
As now my father's presence doth impart.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>go toward</i> <span class="smcap">Carinus:
Alphonsus</span> <i>stands looking on him.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> What, ne'er a word, Alphonsus? art thou dumb?<br />
Or doth my presence so perturb thy mind<br />
That, for because I come in pilgrim's weed,<br />
You think each word which you do spend to me<br />
A great disgrace unto your name to be?<br />
Why speak'st thou not? if that my place you crave,<br />
I will be gone, and you my place shall have.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Nay, father, stay; the gods of heaven forbid<br />
That e'er Alphonsus should desire or wish<br />
To have his absence whom he doth account<br />
To be the loadstar<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of his life!<br />
What, though the Fates and Fortune, both in one,<br />
Have been content to call your loving son<br />
From beggar's state unto this princely seat,<br />
Should I therefore disdain my agèd sire?<br />
No, first both crown and life I will detest,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Before such venom breed within my breast.<br />
What erst I did, the sudden joy I took<br />
To see Carinus in such happy state,<br />
Did make me do, and nothing else at all,<br />
High Jove himself do I to witness call.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> These words are vain; I knew as much before.<br />
But yet, Alphonsus, I must wonder needs<br />
That you, whose years are prone to Cupid's snares,<br />
Can suffer such a goddess as this dame<br />
Thus for to shed such store of crystal tears.<br />
Believe me, son, although my years be spent,<br />
Her sighs and sobs in twain my heart do rent.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Like power, dear father, had she over me,<br />
Until for love I looking to receive<br />
Love back again, not only was denied,<br />
But also taunted in most spiteful sort:<br />
Which made me loathe that which I erst did love,<br />
As she herself, with all her friends, shall prove.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> How now, Alphonsus! you which have so long<br />
Been trainèd up in bloody broils of Mars,<br />
What, know you not that castles are not won<br />
At first assault, and women are not woo'd<br />
When first their suitors proffer love to them?<br />
As for my part, I should account that maid<br />
A wanton wench, unconstant, lewd, and light,<br />
That yields the field before she venture fight;<br />
Especially unto her mortal foe,<br />
As you were then unto Iphigena.<br />
But, for because I see you fitter are<br />
To enter lists and combat with your foes<br />
Than court fair ladies in God Cupid's tents,<br />
Carinus means your spokesman for to be,<br />
And if that she consent, you shall agree.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> What you command Alphonsus must not fly,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Though otherwise perhaps he would deny.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Then, dainty damsel, stint these trickling tears,<br />
Cease sighs and sobs, yea, make a merry cheer;<br />
Your pardon is already purchasèd,<br />
So that you be not over-curious<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><br />
In granting to Alphonsus' just demand.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> Thanks, mighty prince; no curioser I'll be<br />
Than doth become a maid of my degree.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> The gods forbid that e'er Carinus' tongue<br />
Should go about to make a maid consent<br />
Unto the thing which modesty denies:<br />
That which I ask is neither hurt to thee,<br />
Danger to parents, nor disgrace to friends,<br />
But good and honest, and will profit bring<br />
To thee and those which lean unto that thing.<br />
And that is this:&mdash;since first Alphonsus' eyes<br />
Did hap to glance upon your heavenly hue,<br />
And saw the rare perfection of the same,<br />
He hath desirèd to become your spouse:<br />
Now, if you will unto the same agree,<br />
I dare assure you that you shall be free.<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> Pardon, dear lord; the world goes very hard<br />
When womenkind are forcèd for to woo.<br />
If that your son had lovèd me so well,<br />
Why did he not inform me of the same?<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Why did he not! what, have you clean forgot<br />
What ample proffers he did make to you,<br />
When, hand to hand, he did encounter you?<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> No, worthy sir, I have not it forgot;<br />
But Cupid cannot enter in the breast<br />
Where Mars before had took possession:<br />
That was no time to talk of Venus' games<br />
When all our fellows were press'd in the wars.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Well, let that pass: now canst thou be content<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>To love Alphonsus and become his spouse?<br />
<br />
<i>Iphi.</i> Ay, if the high Alphonsus could vouchsafe<br />
To entertain me as his wedded spouse.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> If that he could! what, dost thou doubt of that?<br />
Jason did jet<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> whenas he had obtain'd<br />
The golden fleece by wise Medea's art;<br />
The Greeks rejoicèd when they had subdu'd<br />
The famous bulwarks of most stately Troy;<br />
But all their mirth was nothing in respect<br />
Of this my joy, since that I now have got<br />
That which I long desirèd in my heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> But what says Fausta to her daughter's choice?<br />
<br />
<i>Fausta.</i> Fausta doth say, the gods have been her friends,<br />
To let her live to see Iphigena<br />
Bestowèd so unto her heart's content.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Thanks, mighty empress, for your gentleness,<br />
And, if Alphonsus can at any time<br />
With all his power requite this courtesy,<br />
You shall perceive how kindly he doth take<br />
Your forwardness in this his happy chance.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Albinius, go call forth Amurack:<br />
We'll see what he doth say unto this match.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Albinius</span> <i>brings forth</i> <span class="smcap">Amurack</span>.<br />
Most mighty Turk, I, with my warlike son<br />
Alphonsus, loathing that so great a prince<br />
As you should live in such unseemly sort,<br />
Have sent for you to proffer life or death;<br />
Life, if you do consent to our demand,<br />
And death, if that you dare gainsay the same.<br />
Your wife, high Fausta, with Iphigena,<br />
Have given consent that this my warlike son<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Should have your daughter for his bedfellow:<br />
Now resteth naught but that you do agree,<br />
And so to purchase sure tranquillity.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Now, Amurack, advise thee what thou say'st;<br />
Bethink thee well what answer thou wilt make:<br />
Thy life and death dependeth on thy words.<br />
If thou deny to be Alphonsus' sire,<br />
Death is thy share; but if that thou consent,<br />
Thy life is sav'd. Consent! nay, rather die:<br />
Should I consent to give Iphigena<br />
Into the hands of such a beggar's brat?<br />
What, Amurack, thou dost deceive thyself;<br />
Alphonsus is the son unto a king:<br />
What then? then worthy of thy daughter's love.<br />
She is agreed, and Fausta is content;<br />
Then Amurack will not be discontent.<br />
[<i>Takes</i> <span class="smcap">Iphigena</span> <i>by the hand, and gives
her to</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span>.<br />
Here, brave Alphonsus, take thou at my hand<br />
Iphigena, I give her unto thee;<br />
And for her dowry, when her father dies,<br />
Thou shalt possess the Turkish empery.<br />
Take her, I say, and live King Nestor's years:<br />
So would the Turk and all his noble peers.<br />
<br />
<i>Alphon.</i> Immortal thanks I give unto your grace.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Now, worthy princes, since, by help of Jove,<br />
On either side the wedding is decreed,<br />
Come, let us wend to Naples speedily<br />
For to solémnise it with mirth and glee.<br />
<br />
<i>Amu.</i> As you do will, we jointly do agree.<br />
[<i>Exeunt omnes.</i><br />

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span> <i>with the</i> Muses.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Venus.</i> Now, worthy Muses, with unwilling mind<br />
Venus is forc'd to trudge to heaven again,<br />
For Jupiter, that god of peerless power,<br />
Proclaimed hath a solemn festival<br />
In honour of Dame Danaë's luckless death;<br />
Unto the which, in pain of his displeasure,<br />
He hath invited all the immortal gods<br />
And goddesses, so that I must be there,<br />
Unless I will his high displeasure bear.<br />
You see Alphonsus hath, with much ado,<br />
At length obtained fair Iphigena,<br />
Of Amurack her father, for his wife;<br />
Who now are going to the temple wards,<br />
For to perform Dame Juno's sacred rites;<br />
Where we will leave them, till the feast be done,<br />
Which, in the heavens, by this time is begun.<br />
Meantime, dear Muses, wander you not far<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Forth of the path of high Parnassus' hill,<br />
That, when I come to finish up his life,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><br />
You may be ready for to succour me:<br />
Adieu, dear dames; farewell, Calliope.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Adieu, you sacred goddess of the sky.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span>; <i>or, if you can conveniently, let a
chair come down from the top of the stage, and draw her up.</i><br />
Well, loving sisters, since that she is gone,<br />
Come, let us haste unto Parnassus' hill,<br />
As Cytherea did lately will.<br />
<br />
<i>Melpom.</i> Then make you haste her mind for to fulfil.<br />

FOR LONDON AND
ENGLAND</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>



<p><i>A Looking-Glass for London and England</i> is first mentioned in
Henslowe's <i>Diary</i> as performed by Lord Strange's servants, 8th
March 1592. At this time it was not a new play, and it is probable
that it had first belonged to the Queen's players, to whom Greene
was attached, and that it was by them turned over to Strange's
company along with several other plays when the Queen's company
went to the provinces in 1591. Henslowe records four performances
of the play between 8th March and 7th June 1592. It was
printed by Thomas Creede and entered on the <i>Stationers' Registers</i>,
5th March 1594, as written by Thomas Lodge and Robert Greene,
gent. There is every indication that the play was successful. For
two decades after its appearance Jonah and the Whale were popular
in puppet-shows, and allusions in Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson
and Cowley indicate the vogue of Nineveh on the puppet-stage.
Five early quartos are mentioned by Collins: 1594, in the library of
the Duke of Devonshire; 1598, in the Bodleian and the British
Museum; 1602, in the British Museum; 1617, in the Bodleian and
the British Museum; and apparently an actor's edition with many
variants, formerly in Heber's Library, now in that of Mr Godfrey
Locker Lampson, of the conjectural date 1598. The assignment of
authorship of different portions of the play is difficult and not
entirely profitable. Fleay assigns "most and best" of the play to
Lodge. From their resemblance to the <i>Alarum Against Usurers</i>
Collins assigns the following scenes to Lodge: I. 3; II. 3; V. 2.
He also assigns the speeches of Oseas and Jonas, and the scenes
displaying marine technology, to Lodge, viz.: III. 2; IV. 1.
(<i>See</i> also Gayley, <i>Representative English Comedies</i>, p 405, n.)
This play was one of the earliest in which Greene had a hand and
has been rightly called "a modernised morality."</p>

<h3><i>A LOOKING-GLASS FOR LONDON
AND ENGLAND</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span> <i>in Nineveh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span>, <i>with the</i> <span class="smcap">Kings of Cilicia, Crete</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Paphlagonia</span>, <i>from the overthrow of</i> <span class="smcap">Jeroboam</span>,
<i>King of Jerusalem.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Rasni.</i> So pace ye on, triumphant warriors;<br />
Make Venus' leman,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> arm'd in all his pomp,<br />
Bash at the brightness of your hardy looks;<br />
For you, the viceroys and the cavaliers,<br />
That wait on Rasni's royal mightiness:&mdash;<br />
Boast, petty kings, and glory in your fates,<br />
That stars have made your fortunes climb so high,<br />
To give attend on Rasni's excellence.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Am I not he that rules great Nineveh,<br />
Rounded with Lycus' silver-flowing streams?<br />
Whose city-large diametri contains,<br />
Even three days' journey's length from wall to wall;<br />
Two hundred gates carv'd out of burnish'd brass,<br />
As glorious as the portal of the sun;<br />
And, for to deck heaven's battlements with pride,<br />
Six hundred towers that topless touch the clouds.<br />
This city is the footstool of your king;<br />
A hundred lords do honour at my feet;<br />
My sceptre straineth both the parallels:<br />
And now t' enlarge the highness of my power<br />
I have made Judea's monarch flee the field,<br />
And beat proud Jeroboam from his holds,<br />
Winning from Cadiz to Samaria.<br />
Great Jewry's God, that foil'd stout Benhadad,<br />
Could not rebate<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the strength that Rasni brought;<br />
For be he God in heaven, yet, viceroys, know,<br />
Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> If lovely shape, feature by nature's skill<br />
Passing in beauty fair Endymion's,<br />
That Luna wrapt within her snowy breasts,<br />
Or that sweet boy that wrought bright Venus' bane,<br />
Transform'd unto a purple hyacinth;<br />
If beauty nonpareil in excellence,<br />
May make a king match with the gods in gree,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a><br />
Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Crete.</i> If martial looks, wrapt in a cloud of wars,<br />
More fierce than Mavors lighteneth from his eyes,<br />
Sparkling revenge and dire disparagement;<br />
If doughty deeds more haught than any done,<br />
Seal'd with the smile of fortune and of fate,<br />
Matchless to manage lance and curtle-axe;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>If such high actions, grac'd with victories,<br />
May make a king match with the gods in gree,<br />
Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Paph.</i> If Pallas' wealth&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Viceroys, enough; peace, Paphlagon, no more.<br />
See where's my sister, fair Remilia,<br />
Fairer than was the virgin Danaë<br />
That waits on Venus with a golden show;<br />
She that hath stol'n the wealth of Rasni's looks,<br />
And tied his thoughts within her lovely locks,<br />
She that is lov'd, and love unto your king,<br />
See where she comes to gratulate my fame.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Radagon</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Remilia, Alvida</span>, <i>and</i> Ladies,
<i>bringing a globe seated on a ship.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Remil.</i> Victorious monarch, second unto Jove<br />
Mars upon earth, and Neptune on the seas,<br />
Whose frown strows all the ocean with a calm,<br />
Whose smile draws Flora to display her pride,<br />
Whose eye holds wanton Venus at a gaze,<br />
Rasni, the regent of great Nineveh;<br />
For thou hast foil'd proud Jeroboam's force,<br />
And, like the mustering breath of Æolus,<br />
That overturns the pines of Lebanon,<br />
Hast scatter'd Jewry and her upstart grooms,<br />
Winning from Cadiz to Samaria;&mdash;<br />
Remilia greets thee with a kind salute,<br />
And, for a present to thy mightiness,<br />
Gives thee a globe folded within a ship,<br />
As king on earth and lord of all the seas,<br />
With such a welcome unto Nineveh<br />
As may thy sister's humble love afford.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Sister! the title fits not thy degree;<br />
A higher state of honour shall be thine.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>The lovely trull that Mercury entrapp'd<br />
Within the curious pleasure of his tongue,<br />
And she that bash'd the sun-god with her eyes,<br />
Fair Semele, the choice of Venus' maids,<br />
Were not so beauteous as Remilia.<br />
Then, sweeting, sister shall not serve the turn,<br />
But Rasni's wife, his leman and his love:<br />
Thou shalt, like Juno, wed thyself to Jove,<br />
And fold me in the riches of thy fair;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><br />
Remilia shall be Rasni's paramour.<br />
For why,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> if I be Mars for warlike deeds,<br />
And thou bright Venus for thy clear aspect,<br />
Why should not from our loins issue a son<br />
That might be lord of royal sovereignty,<br />
Of twenty worlds, if twenty worlds might be?<br />
What say'st, Remilia, art thou Rasni's wife?<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> My heart doth swell with favour of thy thoughts;<br />
The love of Rasni maketh me as proud<br />
As Juno when she wore heaven's diadem.<br />
Thy sister born was for thy wife, my love:<br />
Had I the riches nature locketh up<br />
To deck her darling beauty when she smiles,<br />
Rasni should prank him in the pride of all.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Remilia's love is far more richer<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> priz'd<br />
Than Jeroboam's or the world's subdue.<br />
Lordings, I'll have my wedding sumptuous,<br />
Made glorious with the treasures of the world:<br />
I'll fetch from Albia shelves of margarites,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a><br />
And strip the Indies of their diamonds,<br />
And Tyre shall yield me tribute of her gold,<br />
To make Remilia's wedding glorious.<br />
I'll send for all the damosel queens that live<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Within the reach of Rasni's government,<br />
To wait as hand-maids on Remilia,<br />
That her attendant train may pass the troop<br />
That gloried Venus at her wedding-day.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Crete.</i> O my Lord, not sister to thy love!<br />
'Tis incest and too foul a fact for kings;<br />
Nature allows no limits to such lust.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Presumptuous viceroy, dar'st thou check thy lord,<br />
Or twit him with the laws that nature loves?<br />
Is not great Rasni above nature's reach,<br />
God upon earth, and all his will is law?<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Crete.</i> O, flatter not, for hateful is his choice,<br />
And sister's love will blemish all his worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Doth not the brightness of his majesty<br />
Shadow his deeds from being counted faults?<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Well hast thou answer'd with him, Radagon;<br />
I like thee for thy learnèd sophistry.&mdash;<br />
But thou of Crete, that countercheck'st thy king,<br />
Pack hence in exile;&mdash;Radagon the crown!&mdash;<br />
Be thou vicegerent of his royalty,<br />
And fail me not in what my thoughts may please,<br />
For from a beggar have I brought thee up,<br />
And grac'd thee with the honour of a crown.&mdash;<br />
Ye quondam king, what, feed ye on delays?<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Crete.</i> Better no king than viceroy under him,<br />
That hath no virtue to maintain his crown. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Remilia, what fair dames be those that wait<br />
Attendant on thy matchless royalty?<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> 'Tis Alvida, the fair wife to the King of Paphlagonia.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Trust me, she is a fair:&mdash;thou'st, Paphlagon, a jewel,<br />
To fold thee in so bright a sweeting's arms.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Like you her, my lord?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><i>Rasni.</i> What if I do, Radagon?<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Why, then she is yours, my lord; for marriage<br />
Makes no exception, where Rasni doth command.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Paph.</i> Ill dost thou counsel him to fancy wives.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Wife or not wife, whatso he likes is his.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Well answer'd, Radagon; thou art for me:<br />
Feed thou mine humour, and be still a king.&mdash;<br />
Lords, go in triumph of my happy loves,<br />
And, for to feast us after all our broils,<br />
Frolic and revel it in Nineveh.<br />
Whatso'er befitteth your conceited thoughts,<br />
Or good or ill, love or not love, my boys,<br />
In love, or what may satisfy your lust,<br />
Act it, my lords, for no man dare say no.<br />

<p>

Thou'rt brought from Jewry unto Nineveh;<br />
So was Elias wrapt within a storm,<br />

Lo, I have brought thee unto Nineveh,<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> <i>and his crew of</i> Ruffians, <i>to go to drink.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ruffian.</i> Come on, smith, thou shalt be one of the
crew, because thou knowest where the best ale in the
town is.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Come on, in faith, my colts; I have left my
master striking of a heat, and stole away because I
would keep you company.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Why, what, shall we have this paltry smith
with us?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> "Paltry smith"! why, you incarnative knave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
what are you that you speak petty treason against the
smith's trade?</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Why, slave, I am a gentleman of
Nineveh.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> A gentleman! good sir, I remember you well,
and all your progenitors: your father bare office in
our town; an honest man he was, and in great discredit
in the parish, for they bestowed two squires' livings on
him, the one was on working-days, and then he kept
the town stage, and on holidays they made him the
sexton's man, for he whipped dogs out of the church.
Alas, sir, your father,&mdash;why, sir, methinks I see the
gentleman still: a proper youth he was, faith, aged
some forty and ten; his beard rat's colour, half black,
half white; his nose was in the highest degree of noses,
it was nose <i>autem glorificam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> so set with rubies
that after his death it should have been nailed up in
Copper-smiths-hall for a monument. Well, sir, I was
beholding to your good father, for he was the first
man that ever instructed me in the mystery of a pot
of ale.</p>

<p><i>Second Ruf.</i> Well said, smith; that crossed him over
the thumbs.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Villain, were it not that we go to be
merry, my rapier should presently quit<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> thy opproprious
terms.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> O Peter, Peter, put up thy sword, I prithee
heartily, into thy scabbard; hold in your rapier; for
though I have not a long reacher, I have a short hitter.&mdash;Nay
then, gentlemen, stay me, for my choler begins to
rise against him; for mark the words, "a paltry smith"!
O horrible sentence! thou hast in these words, I will
stand to it, libelled against all the sound horses, whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
horses, sore horses, coursers, curtals, jades, cuts,
hackneys and mares: whereupon, my friend, in their
defence, I give thee this curse,&mdash;thou shalt not be worth
a horse of thine own this seven year.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> I prithee, smith, is your occupation so
excellent?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> "A paltry smith"! Why, I'll stand to it, a
smith is lord of the four elements; for our iron is made
of the earth, our bellows blow out air, our floor holds
fire, and our forge water. Nay, sir, we read in the
Chronicles that there was a god of our occupation.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Ay, but he was a cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> That was the reason, sir, he call'd your father
cousin. "Paltry smith"! Why, in this one word thou
hast defaced their worshipful occupation.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Marry, sir, I will stand to it, that a smith in
his kind is a physician, a surgeon and a barber. For
let a horse take a cold, or be troubled with the bots, and
we straight give him a potion or a purgation, in such
physical manner that he mends straight: if he have
outward diseases, as the spavin, splent, ringbone, windgall
or fashion,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> or, sir, a galled back, we let him blood
and clap a plaster to him with a pestilence, that mends
him with a very vengeance: now, if his mane grow out
of order, and he have any rebellious hairs, we straight
to our shears and trim him with what cut it please us,
pick his ears and make him neat. Marry, ay, indeed,
sir, we are slovens for one thing; we never use musk-balls
to wash him with, and the reason is, sir, because
he can woo without kissing.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Well, sirrah, leave off these praises of a
smith, and bring us to the best ale in the town.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Now, sir, I have a feat above all the smiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in Nineveh; for, sir, I am a philosopher that can
dispute of the nature of ale; for mark you, sir, a pot of
ale consists of four parts,&mdash;imprimus the ale, the toast,
the ginger, and the nutmeg.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Excellent!</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> The ale is a restorative, bread is a binder:
mark you, sir, two excellent points in physic; the
ginger, O, ware of that! the philosophers have written of
the nature of ginger, 'tis expulsitive in two degrees;
you shall hear the sentence of Galen,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"It will make a man belch, cough, and fart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And is a great comfort to the heart,"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>a proper posy, I promise you; but now to the noble
virtue of the nutmeg; it is, saith one ballad (I think an
English Roman was the author), an underlayer to the
brains, for when the ale gives a buffet to the head, O
the nutmeg! that keeps him for a while in temper.
Thus you see the description of the virtue of a pot of
ale; now, sir, to put my physical precepts in practice,
follow me: but afore I step any further&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> What's the matter now?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Why, seeing I have provided the ale, who is
the purveyor for the wenches? for, masters, take this
of me, a cup of ale without a wench, why, alas, 'tis like
an egg without salt, or a red-herring without mustard!</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Lead us to the ale; we'll have wenches
enough, I warrant thee.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Oseas.</i> Iniquity seeks out companions still,<br />
And mortal men are armèd to do ill.<br />
London, look on, this matter nips thee near:<br />
Leave off thy riot, pride, and sumptuous cheer;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Spend less at board, and spare not at the door,<br />
But aid the infant, and relieve the poor;<br />

Thou be adjudg'd to endless heaviness.<br />

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>At the</i> Usurer's.</h4>


<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Usurer, <span class="smcap">Thrasybulus</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alcon</span>.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Come on, I am every day troubled with
these needy companions: what news with you? what
wind brings you hither?</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Sir, I hope, how far soever you make it off,
you remember, too well for me, that this is the day
wherein I should pay you money that I took up of you
alate in a commodity.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> And, sir, sir-reverence of your manhood and
gentry, I have brought home such money as you lent
me.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> You, young gentleman, is my money ready?</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Truly, sir, this time was so short, the commodity
so bad, and the promise of friends so broken,
that I could not provide it against the day; wherefore
I am come to entreat you to stand my friend, and to
favour me with a longer time, and I will make you
sufficient consideration.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Is the wind in that door? If thou hast thy
money, so it is: I will not defer a day, an hour, a
minute, but take the forfeit of the bond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> I pray you, sir, consider that my loss was
great by the commodity I took up: you know, sir, I
borrowed of you forty pounds, whereof I had ten pounds
in money, and thirty pounds in lute-strings, which when
I came to sell again, I could get but five pounds for
them, so had I, sir, but fifteen pounds for my forty. In
consideration of this ill bargain, I pray you, sir, give me
a month longer.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> I answered thee afore, not a minute; what
have I to do how thy bargain proved? I have thy hand
set to my book that thou receivedst forty pounds of me
in money.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Ay, sir, it was your device that, to colour the
statute, but your conscience knows what I had.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Friend, thou speakest Hebrew to him when
thou talkest to him of conscience; for he hath as
much conscience about the forfeit of an obligation, as
my blind mare, God bless her, hath over a manger of
oats.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Then there is no favour, sir?</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Come to-morrow to me, and see how I will
use thee.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> No, covetous caterpillar, know that I have
made extreme shift rather than I would fall into the hands
of such a ravening panther; and therefore here is thy
money, and deliver me the recognisance of my lands.</p>

<p><i>Usurer</i> [<i>aside</i>]. What a spite is this!&mdash;hath sped of
his crowns! If he had missed but one half hour, what
a goodly farm had I gotten for forty pounds! Well,
'tis my cursed fortune. O, have I no shift to make him
forfeit his recognisance?</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Come, sir, will you despatch and tell your
money?
[<i>It strikes four o'clock.</i></p>

<p><i>Usurer</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Stay, what is this o'clock? four;&mdash;let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
me see&mdash;"to be paid between the hours of three and
four in the afternoon": this goes right for me.&mdash;You,
sir, hear you not the clock, and have you not a counterpane<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
of your obligation? The hour is past, it was to
be paid between three and four; and now the clock
hath strucken four: I will receive none, I'll stand to
the forfeit of the recognisance.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Why, sir, I hope you do but jest; why, 'tis
but four, and will you for a minute take forfeit of my
bond? If it were so, sir, I was here before four.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Why didst thou not tender thy money then?
if I offer thee injury, take the law of me, complain to
the judge: I will receive no money.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Well, sir, I hope you will stand my good master
for my cow. I borrowed thirty shillings on her, and
for that I have paid you eighteen-pence a week, and
for her meat you have had her milk, and I tell you, sir,
she gives a pretty sup: now, sir, here is your money.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Hang, beggarly knave! comest to me for
a cow? did I not bind her bought and sold for a
penny, and was not thy day to have paid yesterday?
Thou gettest no cow at my hand.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> No cow, sir! alas, that word "no cow" goes as
cold to my heart as a draught of small drink in a frosty
morning! "No cow," sir! Why, alas, alas, Master Usurer,
what shall become of me, my wife, and my poor child?</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Thou gettest no cow of me, knave! I cannot
stand prating with you; I must be gone.</p>

<p><i>Ale.</i> Nay, but hear you, Master Usurer: "no cow!"
Why, sir, here's your thirty shillings: I have paid you
eighteen-pence a week, and therefore there is reason
I should have my cow.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> What pratest thou? have I not answered
thee, thy day is broken?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Why, sir, alas, my cow is a commonwealth to
me! for first, sir, she allows me, my wife, and son, for
to banquet ourselves withal, butter, cheese, whey, curds,
cream, sod-milk, raw-milk, sour-milk, sweet-milk, and
butter-milk: besides, sir, she saved me every year a penny
in almanacs, for she was as good to me as a prognostication;
if she had but set up her tail, and have gallop'd
about the mead, my little boy was able to say, "O, father,
there will be a storm"; her very tail was a calendar to
me: and now to lose my cow! alas, Master Usurer,
take pity upon me!</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> I have other matters to talk on; farewell,
fellows.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Why, but, thou covetous churl, wilt thou not
receive thy money, and deliver me my recognisance?</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> I'll deliver thee none; if I have wronged
thee, seek thy mends at the law. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> And so I will, insatiable peasant.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> And, sir, rather than I will put up this word "no
cow," I will lay my wife's best gown to pawn. I tell you,
sir, when the slave uttered this word "no cow," it struck
to my heart, for my wife shall never have one so fit for
her turn again; for, indeed, sir, she is a woman that hath
her twiddling-strings broke.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> What meanest thou by that, fellow?</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Marry, sir, sir-reverence of your manhood, she
breaks wind behind; and indeed, sir, when she sat
milking of her cow and let a fart, my other cows would
start at the noise, and kick down the milk and away;
but this cow, sir, the gentlest cow! my wife might blow
whilst<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> she burst: and having such good conditions, shall
the Usurer come upon me with "no cow"? Nay, sir,
before I pocket up this word "no cow," my wife's gown
goes to the lawyer: why, alas, sir, 'tis as ill a word to
me as "no crown" to a king!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Well, fellow, go with me, and I'll help thee to
a lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Marry, and I will, sir. No cow! well, the world
goes hard. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Oseas.</i> Where hateful usury<br />
Is counted husbandry;<br />
Where merciless men rob the poor,<br />
And the needy are thrust out of door;<br />
Where gain is held for conscience,<br />
And men's pleasure is all on pence;<br />
Where young gentlemen forfeit their lands,<br />
Through riot, into the usurer's hands;<br />
Where poverty is despis'd, and pity banish'd,<br />
And mercy indeed utterly vanish'd:<br />
Where men esteem more of money than of God;<br />
Let that land look to feel his wrathful rod:<br />
For there is no sin more odious in his sight<br />
Than where usury defrauds the poor of his right.<br />
London, take heed, these sins abound in thee;<br />
The poor complain, the widows wrongèd be;<br />
The gentlemen by subtlety are spoil'd;<br />
The ploughmen lose the crop for which they toil'd:<br />
Sin reigns in thee, O London, every hour:<br />
Repent, and tempt not thus the heavenly power.<br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Remilia</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Alvida</span> <i>and a train of</i> Ladies,
<i>in all royalty.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Remil.</i> Fair queens, yet handmaids unto Rasni's love,<br />
Tell me, is not my state as glorious<br />
As Juno's pomp, when tir'd with heaven's despoil,<br />
Clad in her vestments spotted all with stars,<br />
She cross'd the silver path unto her Jove?<br />
Is not Remilia far more beauteous,<br />
Rich'd with the pride of nature's excellence,<br />
Than Venus in the brightest of her shine?<br />
My hairs, surpass they not Apollo's locks?<br />
Are not my tresses curlèd with such art<br />
As love delights to hide him in their fair?<br />
Doth not mine eye shine like the morning lamp<br />
That tells Aurora when her love will come?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Have I not stol'n the beauty of the heavens,<br />
And plac'd it on the feature of my face?<br />
Can any goddess make compare with me,<br />
Or match her with the fair Remilia?<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> The beauties that proud Paris saw from Troy,<br />
Mustering in Ida for the golden ball,<br />
Were not so gorgeous as Remilia.<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> I have trick'd my trammels up with richest balm,<br />
And made my perfumes of the purest myrrh:<br />
The precious drugs that Ægypt's wealth affords,<br />
The costly paintings fetch'd from curious Tyre,<br />
Have mended in my face what nature miss'd.<br />
Am I not the earth's wonder in my looks?<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> The wonder of the earth, and pride of heaven.<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> Look, Alvida, a hair stands not amiss;<br />
For women's locks are trammels of conceit,<br />
Which do entangle Love for all his wiles.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> Madam, unless you coy it trick and trim,<br />
And play the civil<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> wanton ere you yield,<br />
Smiting disdain of pleasures with your tongue,<br />
Patting your princely Rasni on the cheek<br />
When he presumes to kiss without consent,<br />
You mar the market: beauty naught avails:<br />
You must be proud; for pleasures hardly got<br />
Are sweet if once attain'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> Fair Alvida,<br />
Thy counsel makes Remilia passing wise.<br />
Suppose that thou wert Rasni's mightiness,<br />
And I Remilia, prince of excellence.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> I would be master then of love and thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> "Of love and me! Proud and disdainful king,<br />
Dar'st thou presume to touch a deity,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>Before she grace thee with a yielding smile?"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> "Tut, my Remilia, be not thou so coy;<br />
Say nay, and take it."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> "Careless and unkind!<br />
Talks Rasni to Remilia in such sort<br />
As if I did enjoy a human form?<br />
Look on thy love, behold mine eyes divine,<br />
And dar'st thou twit me with a woman's fault?<br />
Ah Rasni, thou art rash to judge of me.<br />
I tell thee, Flora oft hath woo'd my lips,<br />
To lend a rose to beautify her spring;<br />
The sea-nymphs fetch their lilies from my cheeks:<br />
Then thou unkind!"&mdash;and hereon would I weep.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> And here would Alvida resign her charge;<br />
For were I but in thought th' Assyrian king,<br />
I needs must 'quite thy tears with kisses sweet,<br />
And crave a pardon with a friendly touch:<br />
You know it, madam, though I teach it not,<br />
The touch I mean, you smile whenas you think it.<br />
<br />
<i>Remil.</i> How am I pleas'd to hear thy pretty prate,<br />
According to the humour of my mind!<br />
Ah, nymphs, who fairer than Remilia?<br />
The gentle winds have woo'd me with their sighs,<br />
The frowning air hath clear'd when I did smile;<br />
And when I trac'd upon the tender grass,<br />
Love, that makes warm the centre of the earth,<br />
Lift up his crest to kiss Remilia's foot;<br />
Juno still entertains her amorous Jove<br />
With new delights, for fear he look on me;<br />
The phœnix' feathers are become my fan,<br />
For I am beauty's phœnix in this world.<br />
Shut close these curtains straight, and shadow me,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>For fear Apollo spy me in his walks,<br />
And scorn all eyes, to see Remilia's eyes.<br />
Nymphs, eunuchs, sing, for Mavors draweth nigh:<br />
Hide me in closure, let him long to look:<br />
For were a goddess fairer than am I,<br />
I'll scale the heavens to pull her from the place.<br />
[<i>They draw the curtains, and music plays.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> Believe me, though she say that she is fairest,<br />
I think my penny silver by her leave.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Radagon</span>, <i>with</i> Lords <i>in pomp, who
make a ward about</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span>; <i>with them the</i> Magi <i>in
great pomp.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Rasni.</i> Magi, for love of Rasni, by your art,<br />
By magic frame an arbour out of hand,<br />
For fair Remilia to disport her in.<br />
Meanwhile, I will bethink me on further pomp. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

And blessèd be this day where Hymen hies<br />
To join in union pride of heaven and earth!<br />

What wondrous threatening noise is this I hear?<br />
What flashing lightnings trouble our delights?<br />
When I draw near Remilia's royal tent,<br />
I waking dream of sorrow and mishap.<br />
<br />

These are but common exhalations,<br />
Drawn from the earth, in substance hot and dry,<br />

How pale! as if bereav'd in fatal meads,<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Court of Justice in Nineveh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alcon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Thrasybulus</span>, <i>with their</i> Lawyer.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Thras.</i> I need not, sir, discourse unto you the duty of
lawyers in tendering the right cause of their clients, nor
the conscience you are tied unto by higher command.
Therefore suffice, the Usurer hath done me wrong; you
know the case; and, good sir, I have strained myself to
give you your fees.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Sir, if I should any way neglect so manifest a
truth, I were to be accused of open perjury, for the case
is evident.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> And truly, sir, for my case, if you help me not
for my matter, why, sir, I and my wife are quite undone;
I want my mease<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> of milk when I go to my work, and
my boy his bread and butter when he goes to school.
Master Lawyer, pity me, for surely, sir, I was fain to lay
my wife's best gown to pawn for your fees: when I
looked upon it, sir, and saw how handsomely it was
daubed with statute-lace,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and what a fair mockado<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> cape
it had, and then thought how handsomely it became my
wife,&mdash;truly, sir, my heart is made of butter, it melts at
the least persecution,&mdash;I fell on weeping; but when I
thought on the words the Usurer gave me, "no cow,"
then, sir, I would have stript her into her smock, but I
would make him deliver my cow ere I had done: therefore,
good Master Lawyer, stand my friend.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Trust me, father, I will do for thee as much
as for myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Are you married, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Ay, marry, am I, father.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Then good's benison light on you and your good
wife, and send her that she be never troubled with my
wife's disease.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Why, what's thy wife's disease.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Truly, sir, she hath two open faults, and one
privy fault. Sir, the first is, she is too eloquent for a
poor man, and hath the words of art, for she will call me
rascal, rogue, runagate, varlet, vagabond, slave, knave:
why, alas, sir, and these be but holiday-terms, but if you
heard her working-day words, in faith, sir, they be rattlers
like thunder, sir; for after the dew follows a storm, for
then am I sure either to be well buffeted, my face
scratched, or my head broken: and therefore, good Master
Lawyer, on my knees I ask it, let me not go home again
to my wife with this word "no cow"; for then she will
exercise her two faults upon me with all extremity.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Fear not, man. But what is thy wife's privy
fault?</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Truly, sir, that's a thing of nothing; alas, she,
indeed, sir-reverence of your mastership, doth use to
break wind in her sleep.&mdash;O, sir, here comes the Judge,
and the old caitiff the Usurer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Judge, <i>attended, and the</i> Usurer.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> Sir, here is forty angels for you, and if at any
time you want a hundred pound or two, 'tis ready at your
command, or the feeding of three or four fat bullocks:
whereas these needy slaves can reward with nothing but
a cap and a knee; and therefore I pray you, sir, favour
my case.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Fear not, sir, I'll do what I can for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> What, Master Lawyer, what make you here?
mine adversary for these clients?</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> So it chanceth now, sir.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> I know you know the old proverb, "He is
not wise that is not wise for himself": I would not be
disgraced in this action; therefore here is twenty angels;
say nothing in the matter, or what you say, say to no
purpose, for the Judge is my friend.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Let me alone, I'll fit your purpose.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Come, where are these fellows that are the
plaintiffs? what can they say against this honest citizen
our neighbour, a man of good report amongst all men?</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Truly, Master Judge, he is a man much spoken
of; marry, every man's cries are against him, and
especially we; and therefore I think we have brought
our Lawyer to touch him with as much law as will fetch
his lands and my cow with a pestilence.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Sir, I am the other plaintiff, and this is my
counsellor: I beseech your honour be favourable to me
in equity.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> O, Signor Mizaldo, what can you say in this
gentleman's behalf?</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Faith, sir, as yet little good.&mdash;Sir, tell you
your own case to the Judge, for I have so many matters
in my head, that I have almost forgotten it.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Is the wind in that door? Why then, my
lord, thus. I took up of this cursed Usurer, for so I may
well term him, a commodity of forty pounds, whereof I
received ten pound in money, and thirty pound in lute-strings,
whereof I could by great friendship make but five
pounds: for the assurance of this bad commodity I bound
him my land in recognisance: I came at my day, and
tendered him his money, and he would not take it: for
the redress of my open wrong I crave but justice.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> What say you to this, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> That first he had no lute-strings of me; for,
look you, sir, I have his own hand to my book for the
receipt of forty pound.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> That was, sir, but a device of him to colour
the statute.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Well, he hath thine own hand, and we can
crave no more in law.&mdash;But now, sir, he says his money
was tendered at the day and hour.</p>

<p><i>Usurer.</i> This is manifest contrary, sir, and on that I
will depose; for here is the obligation, "to be paid
between three and four in the afternoon," and the clock
struck four before he offered it, and the words be
"between three and four," therefore to be tendered before
four.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Sir, I was there before four, and he held me
with brabbling<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> till the clock struck, and then for the
breach of a minute he refused my money, and kept the
recognisance of my land for so small a trifle.&mdash;Good
Signor Mizaldo, speak what is law; you have your fee,
you have heard what the case is, and therefore do me
justice and right: I am a young gentleman, and speak
for my patrimony.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Faith, sir, the case is altered; you told me it
before in another manner: the law goes quite against
you, and therefore you must plead to the Judge for favour.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> [<i>Aside</i>]. O execrable bribery!</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Faith, Sir Judge, I pray you let me be the gentleman's
counsellor, for I can say thus much in his defence,
that the Usurer's clock is the swiftest clock in all the
town: 'tis, sir, like a woman's tongue, it goes ever half-an-hour
before the time; for when we were gone from him,
other clocks in the town struck four.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Hold thy prating, fellow:&mdash;and you, young
gentleman, this is my ward: look better another time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
both to your bargains and to the payments; for I must
give flat sentence against you, that, for default of tendering
the money between the hours, you have forfeited
your recognisance, and he to have the land.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> [<i>Aside</i>]. O inspeakable injustice!</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> [<i>Aside</i>]. O monstrous, miserable, moth-eaten
Judge!</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Now you, fellow, what have you to say for your
matter?</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Master Lawyer, I laid my wife's gown to pawn
for your fees: I pray you, to this gear.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Alas, poor man, thy matter is out of my
head, and therefore, I pray thee, tell it thyself.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> I hold my cap to a noble,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that the Usurer hath
given him some gold, and he, chewing it in his mouth,
hath got the toothache that he cannot speak.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Well, sirrah, I must be short, and therefore
say on.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Master Judge, I borrowed of this man thirty
shillings, for which I left him in pawn my good cow;
the bargain was, he should have eighteen-pence a week,
and the cow's milk for usury: now, sir, as soon as I had
gotten the money, I brought it him, and broke but a day,
and for that he refused his money, and keeps my cow,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Why, thou hast given sentence against thyself,
for in breaking thy day thou hast lost thy cow.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Master Lawyer, now for my ten shillings.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> Faith, poor man, thy case is so bad, I shall
but speak against thee.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> 'Twere good, then, I should have my ten
shillings again.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer.</i> 'Tis my fee, fellow, for coming: wouldst thou
have me come for nothing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Why, then, am I like to go home, not only with
no cow, but no gown: this gear goes hard.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Well, you have heard what favour I can show
you: I must do justice.&mdash;Come, Master Mizaldo,&mdash;and
you, sir, go home with me to dinner.</p>

<p>
<i>Alc.</i> Why, but, Master Judge, no cow!&mdash;and, Master Lawyer, no gown!<br />
Then must I clean run out of the town.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> Judge, Lawyer, Usurer, <i>and</i> Attendants.<br />
How cheer you, gentleman? you cry "no lands" too;
the Judge hath made you a knight for a gentleman, hath
dubbed you Sir John Lack-land.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> O miserable time, wherein gold is above God!</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Fear not, man; I have yet a fetch to get thy
lands and my cow again, for I have a son in the court,
that is either a king or a king's fellow, and to him will I
go and complain on the Judge and the Usurer both.</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> And I will go with thee, and entreat him for
my case.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> But how shall I go home to my wife, when I shall
have nothing to say unto her but "no cow"? alas, sir, my
wife's faults will fall upon me!</p>

<p><i>Thras.</i> Fear not; let's go; I'll quiet her, shalt see.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Oseas.</i> Fly, judges, fly corruption in your court;<br />
The judge of truth hath made your judgment short.<br />
Look so to judge that at the latter day<br />
Ye be not judg'd with those that wend astray.<br />
Who passeth judgment for his private gain,<br />
He well may judge he is adjudg'd to pain.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>and his crew of</i> Ruffians <i>drunk.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Farewell, gentle tapster.&mdash;Masters, as good ale
as ever was tapt; look to your feet, for the ale is strong.&mdash;Well,
farewell, gentle tapster.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> [<i>to Second Ruf.</i>] Why, sirrah slave, by
heaven's maker, thinkest thou the wench loves thee
best because she laughed on thee? give me but
such another word, and I will throw the pot at
thy head.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Spill no drink, spill no drink, the ale is good:
I'll tell you what, ale is ale, and so I'll commend me to
you with hearty commendations.&mdash;Farewell, gentle
tapster.</p>

<p><i>Second Ruf.</i> Why, wherefore, peasant, scornest thou
that the wench should love me? look but on her, and
I'll thrust my dagger in thy bosom.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Well, sirrah, well, tha'rt as tha'rt, and so
I'll take thee.</p>

<p><i>Second Ruf.</i> Why, what am I?</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> Why, what thou wilt; a slave.</p>

<p><i>Second Ruf.</i> Then take that, villain, and learn how
thou use me another time. [<i>Stabs</i> First Ruf.</p>

<p><i>First Ruf.</i> O, I am slain! [<i>Dies.</i></p>

else farewell, gentle tapster.</p>

<p><i>First Lord.</i> Sirrah, thou fellow, thou must come to

<p><i>Adam.</i> I will not do a stroke of work to-day, for the
ale is good ale, and you can ask but a penny for a pot,
no more by the statute.</p>

Nineveh hath not such a cup of ale, it flowers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

races more.</p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> Why, good fellow, the king talks not of drink;
he would have thee tell him how this man came dead.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Dead! nay, I think I am alive yet, and will
drink a full pot ere night: but hear ye, if ye be the
wench that filled us drink, why, so, do your office, and
give us a fresh pot; or if you be the tapster's wife, why,
so, wash the glass clean.</p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> He is so drunk, my lord, there is no talking
with him.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Drunk! nay, then, wench, I am not drunk:
th'art shitten quean to call me drunk; I tell thee I am
not drunk, I am a smith, I.</p>

dead?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> May it please your highness, my man here

so drunk that one of them killed another; and now, sir,
I am fain to leave my shop, and come to fetch him home.</p>

<h3>ACT THE THIRD</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Seaport in Judea.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jonas</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Jonas.</i> From forth the depth of my imprison'd soul<br />
Steal you, my sighs, [to] testify my pain;<br />
Convey on wings of mine immortal tone,<br />
My zealous prayers unto the starry throne.<br />
Ah, merciful and just, thou dreadful God!<br />
Where is thine arm to lay revengeful strokes<br />
Upon the heads of our rebellious race?<br />
Lo, Israel, once that flourish'd like the vine,<br />
Is barren laid; the beautiful increase<br />
Is wholly blent, and irreligious zeal<br />
Encampeth there where virtue was enthron'd:<br />
Alas, the while the widow wants relief,<br />
The fatherless is wrong'd by naked need,<br />
Devotion sleeps in cinders of contempt,<br />
Hypocrisy infects the holy priest!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>Ah me, for this! woe me, for these misdeeds!<br />
Alone I walk to think upon the world,<br />
And sigh to see thy prophets so contemn'd,<br />
Alas, contemn'd by cursèd Israel!<br />
Yet, Jonas, rest content, 'tis Israel's sin<br />
That causeth this; then muse no more thereon,<br />
But pray amends, and mend thy own amiss.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>An</i> Angel <i>appears to</i> <span class="smcap">Jonas</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Angel.</i> Amittai's son, I charge thee muse no more:<br />
I AM hath power to pardon and correct;<br />
To thee pertains to do the Lord's command.<br />
Go girt thy loins, and haste thee quickly hence;<br />
To Nineveh, that mighty city, wend,<br />
And say this message from the Lord of hosts,<br />
Preach unto them these tidings from thy God;&mdash;<br />
"Behold, thy wickedness hath tempted me,<br />
And piercèd through the nine-fold orbs of heaven:<br />
Repent, or else thy judgment is at hand."<br />
[<i>This said, the</i> Angel <i>vanishes.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Jonas.</i> Prostrate I lie before the Lord of hosts,<br />
With humble ears intending<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> his behest:<br />
Ah, honour'd be Jehovah's great command!<br />
Then Jonas must to Nineveh repair,<br />
Commanded as the prophet of the Lord.<br />
Great dangers on this journey do await,<br />
But dangers none where heavens direct the course.<br />
What should I deem? I see, yea, sighing see,<br />
How Israel sins, yet knows the way of truth,<br />
And thereby grows the bye-word of the world.<br />
How, then, should God in judgment be so strict<br />
'Gainst those who never heard or knew his power.<br />
To threaten utter ruin of them all?<br />
Should I report this judgment of my God,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>I should incite them more to follow sin,<br />
And publish to the world my country's blame.<br />
It may not be, my conscience tells me&mdash;no.<br />
Ah, Jonas, wilt thou prove rebellious then?<br />
Consider, ere thou fall, what error is.<br />
My mind misgives: to Joppa will I fly,<br />
And for a while to Tharsus shape my course,<br />
Until the Lord unfret his angry brows.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter certain</i> Merchants <i>of</i> Tharsus, <i>a</i> Master, <i>and some</i>
Sailors.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Master.</i> Come on, brave merchants; now the wind doth serve,<br />
And sweetly blows a gale at west-south-west,<br />
Our yards across; our anchor's on the pike;<br />
What, shall we hence, and take this merry gale?<br />
<br />
<i>First Mer.</i> Sailors, convey our budgets straight aboard,<br />
And we will recompense your pains at last:<br />
If once in safety we may Tharsus see,<br />
Master, we'll feast these merry mates and thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Master.</i> Meanwhile content yourselves with silly cates;<br />
Our beds are boards, our feasts are full of mirth:<br />
We use no pomp, we are the lords of sea;<br />
When princes sweat in care, we swink<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> of glee.<br />
Orion's shoulders and the Pointers serve<br />
To be our loadstars in the lingering night;<br />
The beauties of Arcturus we behold;<br />
And though the sailor is no bookman held,<br />
He knows more art than ever bookmen read.<br />
<br />
<i>First Sai.</i> By heavens, well said in honour of our trade!<br />
Let's see the proudest scholar steer his course,<br />
Or shift his tides, as silly sailors do;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Then will we yield them praise, else never none.<br />
<br />
<i>First Mer.</i> Well spoken, fellow, in thine own behalf.<br />
But let us hence: wind tarries none, you wot,<br />
And tide and time let slip is hardly got.<br />
<br />
<i>Master.</i> March to the haven, merchants; I follow you.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> Merchants.<br />

I find companions fit to aid my flight.&mdash;<br />
Stay, sir, I pray, and hear a word or two.<br />

My passengers by this time are aboard.<br />
<br />

Our ship is prest<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and ready to depart.<br />
<br />

<br />

You are a welcome guest, if so you please.<br />

<br />
<i>Master.</i> Where is your budget? let me bear it, sir.<br />
<br />

Put trust in him who succoureth every want.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

And tie the power of heaven to their conceits;<br />

Woe to the flock whereas the shepherd's foul!<br />
For, lo, the Lord at unawares shall plague<br />
The careless guide, because his flocks do stray.<br />
The axe already to the tree is set:<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Public Place in Nineveh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alcon, Thrasybulus, Samia</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clesiphon</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cles.</i> Mother, some meat, or else I die for want.</p>

<p>
<i>Samia.</i> Ah little boy, how glad thy mother would<br />
Supply thy wants, but naked need denies!<br />
Thy father's slender portion in this world<br />
By usury and false deceit is lost:<br />
No charity within this city bides;<br />
All for themselves, and none to help the poor.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Cles.</i> Father, shall Clesiphon have no relief?</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Faith, my boy, I must be flat with thee, we must
feed upon proverbs now; as "Necessity hath no law,"
"A churl's feast is better than none at all;" for other
remedies have we none, except thy brother Radagon
help us.</p>

<p>
<i>Samia.</i> Is this thy slender care to help our child?<br />
Hath nature arm'd thee to no more remorse?<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a><br />
Ah, cruel man, unkind and pitiless!&mdash;<br />
Come, Clesiphon, my boy, I'll beg for thee.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Cles.</i> O, how my mother's mourning moveth me!</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Nay, you shall pay me interest for getting the
boy, wife, before you carry him hence: alas, woman,
what can Alcon do more? I'll pluck the belly out of
my heart for thee, sweet Samia; be not so waspish.</p>

<p>
<i>Samia.</i> Ah silly man, I know thy want is great,<br />
And foolish I to crave where nothing is.<br />
Haste, Alcon, haste, make haste unto our son;<br />
Who, since he is in favour of the king,<br />
May help this hapless gentleman and us<br />
For to regain our goods from tyrant's hands.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><i>Thras.</i> Have patience, Samia, wait your weal from heaven:<br />
The gods have rais'd your son, I hope, for this,<br />
To succour innocents in their distress.<br />
Lo, where he comes from the imperial court;<br />
Go, let us prostrate us before his feet.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Nay, by my troth, I'll never ask my son's blessing;
che trow, cha<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> taught him his lesson to know his father.</p>

<p>What, son Radagon! i'faith, boy, how dost thee?</p>

<p><i>Radag.</i> Villain, disturb me not; I cannot stay.</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Tut, son, I'll help you of that disease quickly,
for I can hold thee: ask thy mother, knave, what cunning
I have to ease a woman when a qualm of kindness
comes too near her stomach; let me but clasp mine
arms about her body, and say my prayers in her bosom,
and she shall be healed presently.</p>

<p>
<i>Radag.</i> Traitor unto my princely majesty,<br />
How dar'st thou lay thy hands upon a king?<br />
<br />
<i>Samia.</i> No traitor, Radagon, but true is he:<br />
What, hath promotion blearèd thus thine eye,<br />
To scorn thy father when he visits thee?<br />
Alas, my son, behold with ruthful eyes<br />
Thy parents robb'd of all their worldly weal<br />
By subtle means of usury and guile:<br />
The judge's ears are deaf and shut up close;<br />
All mercy sleeps: then be thou in these plunges<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><br />
A patron to thy mother in her pains:<br />
Behold thy brother almost dead for food:<br />
O, succour us, that first did succour thee!<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> What, succour me! false callet,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> hence, avaunt!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Old dotard, pack! move not my patience:<br />
I know you not; kings never look so low.<br />
<br />
<i>Samia.</i> You know us not! O Radagon, you know<br />
That, knowing us, you know your parents then;<br />
Thou know'st this womb first brought thee forth to light:<br />
I know these paps did foster thee, my son.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> And I know he hath had many a piece of
bread and cheese at my hands, as proud as he is; that
know I.</p>

<p>
<i>Thras.</i> I wait no hope of succour in this place,<br />
Where children hold their fathers in disgrace.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Dare you enforce the furrows of revenge<br />
Within the brows of royal Radagon?<br />
Villain, avaunt! hence, beggars, with your brats!&mdash;<br />
Marshal, why whip you not these rogues away,<br />
That thus disturb our royal majesty?<br />
<br />
<i>Cles.</i> Mother, I see it is a wondrous thing,<br />
From base estate for to become a king;<br />
For why, methink, my brother in these fits<br />
Hath got a kingdom, and hath lost his wits.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Yet more contempt before my royalty?<br />
Slaves, fetch out tortures worse than Tityus' plagues,<br />
And tear their tongues from their blasphémous heads.<br />
<br />
<i>Thras.</i> I'll get me gone, though wo-begone with grief:<br />
No hope remains:&mdash;come, Alcon, let us wend.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> 'Twere best you did, for fear you catch your bane.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Thrasybulus</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Samia.</i> Nay, traitor, I will haunt thee to the death:<br />
Ungracious son, untoward, and perverse,<br />
I'll fill the heavens with echoes of thy pride,<br />
And ring in every ear thy small regard,<br />
That dost despise thy parents in their wants;<br />
And breathing forth my soul before thy feet,<br />
My curses still shall haunt thy hateful head,<br />
And being dead, my ghost shall thee pursue.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rasni</span>, <i>attended on by his</i> Magi <i>and</i> Kings.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Rasni.</i> How now! what mean these outcries in our court,<br />
Where naught should sound but harmonies of heaven?<br />
What maketh Radagon so passionate?<br />
<br />
<i>Samia.</i> Justice, O king, justice against my son!<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Thy son! what son?<br />
<br />
<i>Samia.</i> This cursèd Radagon.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Dread monarch, this is but a lunacy,<br />
Which grief and want hath brought the woman to.&mdash;<br />
What, doth this passion hold you every moon?<br />
<br />

Too impudent for to delude thy prince!&mdash;<br />
O Rasni, this same womb first brought him forth:<br />
This is his father, worn with care and age,<br />
This is his brother, poor unhappy lad,<br />
And I his mother, though contemn'd by him.<br />
With tedious toil we got our little good,<br />
And brought him up to school with mickle charge:<br />
Lord, how we joy'd to see his towardness!<br />
And to ourselves we oft in silence said,<br />
This youth when we are old may succour us.<br />
But now preferr'd, and lifted up by thee,<br />
We quite destroy'd by cursèd usury,<br />
He scorneth me, his father, and this child.<br />

That sought the foster's death, that lately gave him life.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> Nay, an please your majesty-ship, for proof he
was my child, search the parish-book: the clerk will
swear it, his godfathers and godmothers can witness it:
it cost me forty pence in ale and cakes on the wives
at his christening.&mdash;Hence, proud king! thou shalt never
more have my blessing!</p>

<i>Rasni</i> [<i>taking</i> <span class="smcap">Radagon</span> <i>apart</i>].<br />
Say sooth in secret, Radagon,<br />
Is this thy father?<br />

I blushing tell it to your majesty.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> Why dost thou, then, contemn him and his friends?<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Because he is a base and abject swain,<br />
My mother and her brat both beggarly,<br />
Unmeet to be allied unto a king.<br />
Should I, that look on Rasni's countenance,<br />
And march amidst his royal equipage,<br />
Embase myself to speak to such as they?<br />
'Twere impious so to impair the love<br />
That mighty Rasni bears to Radagon.<br />
I would your grace would quit them from your sight,<br />
That dare presume to look on Jove's compare.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> I like thy pride, I praise thy policy;<br />
Such should they be that wait upon my court:<br />
Let me alone to answer, Radagon.&mdash;<br />
Villains, seditious traitors, as you be,<br />
That scandalise the honour of a king,<br />
Depart my court, you stales of impudence,<br />
Unless you would be parted from your limbs!<br />
Too base for to entitle fatherhood<br />
To Rasni's friend, to Rasni's favourite.<br />
<br />
<i>Radag.</i> Hence, begging scold! hence, caitiff clogg'd with years!<br />
On pain of death, revisit not the court.<br />
Was I conceiv'd by such a scurvy trull,<br />
Or brought to light by such a lump of dirt?<br />
Go, losel, trot it to the cart and spade!<br />
Thou art unmeet to look upon a king.<br />
Much less to be the father of a king.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Alc.</i> You may see, wife, what a goodly piece of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

of a boy, and to be banished for my labour? O pitiful

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Within the</i> Smith's <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>and the</i> Smith's Wife.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Why, but hear you, mistress: you know a
woman's eyes are like a pair of pattens, fit to save shoe-leather
in summer, and to keep away the cold in
winter; so you may like your husband with the one eye,
because you are married, and me with the other, because
I am your man. Alas, alas! think, mistress, what a
thing love is: why, it is like to an ostry-faggot,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that,
once set on fire, is as hardly quenched as the bird<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
crocodile driven out of her nest.</p>

<p><i>S. Wife.</i> Why, Adam, cannot a woman wink but she
must sleep? and can she not love but she must cry it
out at the cross? Know, Adam, I love thee as myself,
now that we are together in secret.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Mistress, these words of yours are like to a
fox-tail placed in a gentlewoman's fan, which, as it is
light, so it giveth life: O, these words are as sweet as a
lily! whereupon, offering a borachio<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> of kisses to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
unseemly personage, I entertain you upon further
acquaintance.</p>

And say no words but mum.<br />

<p><i>Enter the</i> Smith.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Sirrah you, and you, huswife, well taken together!
I have long suspected you, and now I am glad
I have found you together.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Truly, sir, and I am glad that I may do you any
way pleasure, either in helping you or my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Boy here, and knave, you shall know it
straight; I will have you both before the magistrate,
and there have you surely punished.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Why, then, master, you are jealous?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Jealous, knave! how can I be but jealous, to
see you ever so familiar together? Thou art not only
content to drink away my goods, but to abuse my wife.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Two good qualities, drunkenness and lechery:
but, master, are you jealous?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Ay, knave, and thou shalt know it ere I pass,
for I will beswinge thee while this rope will hold.</p>

<p><i>S. Wife.</i> My good husband, abuse him not, for he
never proffered you any wrong.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Nay, whore, thy part shall not be behind.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Why, suppose, master, I have offended you, is
it lawful for the master to beat the servant for all
offences?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Ay, marry, is it, knave.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Then, master, will I prove by logic, that seeing
all sins are to receive correction, the master is to be
corrected of the man. And, sir, I pray you, what greater
sin is than jealousy? 'tis like a mad dog that for anger
bites himself: therefore that I may do my duty to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
good master, and to make a white<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> son of you, I will so
beswinge jealousy out of you, as you shall love me the
better while you live.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> What, beat thy master, knave?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> What, beat thy man, knave? and, ay, master,
and double beat you, because you are a man of credit;
and therefore have at you the fairest for forty pence.
[<i>Beats the</i> Smith.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Alas, wife, help, help! my man kills me.</p>

<p><i>S. Wife.</i> Nay, even as you have baked, so brew:
jealousy must be driven out by extremities.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> And that will I do, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Hold thy hand, Adam; and not only I forgive
and forget all, but I will give thee a good farm to
live on.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Begone, peasant, out of the compass of my
further wrath, for I am a corrector of vice; and at night
I will bring home my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Even when you please, good Adam.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> When I please,&mdash;mark the words&mdash;'tis a lease-parol,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
to have and to hold. Thou shalt be mine for
ever: and so let's go to the ale-house. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Oseas.</i> Where servants against masters do rebel,<br />
The commonweal may be accounted hell;<br />
For if the feet the head shall hold in scorn,<br />
The city's state will fall and be forlorn.<br />
This error, London, waiteth on thy state:<br />
Servants, amend, and, masters, leave to hate;<br />
Let love abound, and virtue reign in all;<br />
So God will hold his hand, that threateneth thrall.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Joppa.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Merchants <i>of Tharsus, the</i> Master <i>of the Ship
and some</i> Sailors, <i>wet from the sea; with them the</i>
Governor <i>of Joppa.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Gov.</i> What strange encounters met you on the sea,<br />
That thus your bark is batter'd by the floods,<br />
And you return thus sea-wreck'd as I see?<br />
<br />
<i>First Mer.</i> Most mighty Governor, the chance is strange,<br />
The tidings full of wonder and amaze,<br />
Which, better than we, our Master can report.<br />
<br />
<i>Gov.</i> Master, discourse us all the accident.<br />
<br />
<i>Master.</i> The fair Triones with their glimmering light<br />
Smil'd at the foot of clear Bootes' wain,<br />
And in the north, distinguishing the hours,<br />
The loadstar of our course dispers'd his clear;<br />
When to the seas with blitheful western blasts<br />
We sail'd amain, and let the bowling fly.<br />
Scarce had we gone ten leagues from sight of land,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>But, lo, an host of black and sable clouds<br />
'Gan to eclipse Lucina's silver face;<br />
And, with a hurling noise from forth the south,<br />
A gust of wind did rear the billows up.<br />
Then scantled we our sails with speedy hands,<br />
And took our drablers<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> from our bonnets straight,<br />
And severèd our bonnets from the courses:<br />
Our topsails up, we truss our spritsails in;<br />
But vainly strive they that resist the heavens.<br />
For, lo, the waves incense them more and more,<br />
Mounting with hideous roarings from the depth;<br />
Our bark is batter'd by encountering storms,<br />
And well-nigh stemm'd by breaking of the floods.<br />
The steersman, pale and careful, holds his helm,<br />
Wherein the trust of life and safety lay:<br />
Till all at once (a mortal tale to tell)<br />
Our sails were split by Bisa's<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> bitter blast.<br />
Our rudder broke, and we bereft of hope.<br />
There might you see, with pale and ghastly looks,<br />
The dead in thought, and doleful merchants lift<br />
Their eyes and hands unto their country's gods.<br />
The goods we cast in bowels of the sea,<br />
A sacrifice to 'suage proud Neptune's ire.<br />
Only alone a man of Israel,<br />
A passenger, did under hatches lie,<br />
And slept secure, when we for succour pray'd:<br />
Him I awoke, and said, "Why slumberest thou?<br />
Arise, and pray, and call upon thy god;<br />
He will perhaps in pity look on us."<br />
Then cast we lots to know by whose amiss<br />
Our mischief came, according to the guise;<br />
And, lo, the lot did unto Jonas fall,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>The Israelite of whom I told you last.<br />
Then question we his country and his name;<br />
Who answer'd us, "I am an Hebrew born,<br />
Who fear the Lord of heaven who made the sea,<br />
And fled from him, for which we all are plagu'd:<br />
So, to assuage the fury of my God,<br />
Take me and cast my carcass in the sea;<br />
Then shall this stormy wind and billow cease."<br />
The heavens they know, the Hebrew's God can tell,<br />
How loath we were to execute his will:<br />
But when no oars nor labour might suffice,<br />
We heav'd the hapless Jonas overboard.<br />
So ceas'd the storm, and calmèd all the sea,<br />
And we by strength of oars recover'd shore.<br />
<br />
<i>Gov.</i> A wondrous chance of mighty consequence!<br />
<br />
<i>First Mer.</i> Ah, honour'd be the god that wrought the same!<br />
For we have vow'd, that saw his wondrous works,<br />
To cast away profanèd paganism,<br />
And count the Hebrew's god the only god:<br />
To him this offering of the purest gold,<br />
This myrrh and cassia, freely I do yield.<br />
<br />
<i>Master.</i> And on his altar's fume these Turkey cloths,<br />
This gossampine<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and gold, I'll sacrifice.<br />
<br />
<i>First Sai.</i> To him my heart and thoughts I will addict.<br />
Then suffer us, most mighty Governor,<br />
Within your temples to do sacrifice.<br />
<br />
<i>Gov.</i> You men of Tharsus, follow me.<br />
Who sacrifice unto the God of heaven<br />
Are welcome friends to Joppa's Governor.<br />
[<i>Exeunt. A sacrifice.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Oseas.</i> If warnèd once, the ethnics thus repent,<br />
And at the first their error do lament,<br />
What senseless beasts, devourèd in their sin,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Are they whom long persuasions cannot win!<br />
Beware, ye western cities,&mdash;where the word<br />
Is daily preachèd, both at church and board,<br />
Where majesty the gospel doth maintain,<br />
Where preachers, for your good, themselves do pain,&mdash;<br />
To dally long and still protract the time;<br />
The Lord is just, and you but dust and slime:<br />
Presume not far, delay not to amend;<br />
Who suffereth long, will punish in the end.<br />
Cast thy account, O London, in this case,<br />
Then judge what cause thou hast to call for grace!<br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The Seashore near Nineveh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonas</span> <i>is cast out of the Whale's belly upon the Stage.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Jonas.</i> Lord of the light, thou maker of the world,<br />
Behold, thy hands of mercy rear me up!<br />
Lo, from the hideous bowels of this fish<br />
Thou hast return'd me to the wishèd air!<br />
Lo, here, apparent witness of thy power,<br />
The proud leviathan that scours the seas,<br />
And from his nostrils showers out stormy floods,<br />
Whose back resists the tempest of the wind,<br />
Whose presence makes the scaly troops to shake,<br />
With humble stress of his broad-open'd chaps,<br />
Hath lent me harbour in the raging floods!<br />
Thus, though my sin hath drawn me down to death,<br />
Thy mercy hath restorèd me to life.<br />
Bow ye, my knees; and you, my bashful eyes,<br />
Weep so for grief as you to water would.<br />
In trouble, Lord, I callèd unto thee;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Out of the belly of the deepest hell<br />
I cried, and thou didst hear my voice, O God!<br />
'Tis thou hadst cast me down into the deep:<br />
The seas and floods did compass me about;<br />
I thought I had been cast from out thy sight;<br />
The weeds were wrapt about my wretched head;<br />
I went unto the bottom of the hills:<br />
But thou, O Lord my God, hast brought me up!<br />
On thee I thought whenas my soul did faint<br />
My prayers did prease<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> before thy mercy-seat.<br />
Then will I pay my vows unto the Lord,<br />
For why salvation cometh from his throne.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> Angel <i>appears.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Angel.</i> Jonas, arise, get thee to Nineveh,<br />
And preach to them the preachings that I bade;<br />
Haste thee to see the will of heaven perform'd.<br />
[<i>The</i> Angel <i>departs.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Jonas.</i> Jehovah, I am prest<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> to do thy will.&mdash;<br />
What coast is this, and where am I arriv'd?<br />
Behold sweet Lycus streaming in his bounds,<br />
Bearing the walls of haughty Nineveh,<br />
Whereas three hundred towers do tempt the heaven.<br />
Fair are thy walls, pride of Assyria;<br />
But, lo, thy sins have piercèd through the clouds!<br />
Here will I enter boldly, since I know<br />
My God commands, whose power no power resists.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Oseas.</i> You prophets, learn by Jonas how to live;<br />
Repent your sins, whilst he doth warning give.<br />
Who knows his master's will, and doth it not,<br />
Shall suffer many stripes, full well I wot.<br />

<p>
<i>Alvi.</i> Ladies, go sit you down amidst this bower,<br />
And let the eunuchs play you all asleep:<br />
Put garlands made of roses on your heads,<br />
And play the wantons whilst I talk a while.<br />
<br />
<i>First Lady.</i> Thou beautiful of all the world, we will.<br />
[Ladies <i>enter the bower.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> King of Cilicia, kind and courteous,<br />
Like to thyself, because a lovely king,<br />
Come, lay thee down upon thy mistress' knee,<br />
And I will sing and talk of love to thee.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> Most gracious paragon of excellence,<br />
It fits not such an abject prince as I,<br />
To talk with Rasni's paramour and love.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> To talk, sweet friend! Who would not talk with thee?<br />
O, be not coy! art thou not only fair?<br />
Come, twine thine arms about this snow-white neck,<br />
A love-nest for the great Assyrian king:<br />
Blushing I tell thee, fair Cilician prince,<br />
None but thyself can merit such a grace.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> Madam, I hope you mean not for to mock me.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> No, king, fair king, my meaning is to yoke thee.<br />
Hear me but sing of love, then by my sighs,<br />
My tears, my glancing looks, my changèd cheer,<br />
Thou shalt perceive how I do hold thee dear.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> Sing, madam, if you please, but love in jest.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> Your love is fixèd on a greater king.<br />
<br />
<i>Alvi.</i> Tut, women's love it is a fickle thing.<br />
I love my Rasni for his dignity,<br />
I love Cilician king for his sweet eye;<br />
I love my Rasni since he rules the world,<br />
But more I love this kingly little world.<br />

<p><i>Devil.</i> Longer lives a merry man than a sad; and
because I mean to make myself pleasant this night, I

many strange apparitions, to the great fear and terror of
the citizens.&mdash;O, here my young master comes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>and the</i> Smith's Wife.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Fear not, mistress, I'll bring you safe home:
if my master frown, then will I stamp and stare; and if
all be not well then, why then to-morrow morn put out
mine eyes clean with forty pound.</p>

<p><i>S. Wife.</i> O, but, Adam, I am afraid to walk so late,
because of the spirits that appear in the city.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> What, are you afraid of spirits? Armed as I
am, with ale and nutmegs, turn me loose to all the
devils in hell.</p>

deal well enough, if he have any honesty at all in him:
I'll either win him with a smooth tale, or else with a
toast and a cup of ale.</p>

together.</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> And therefore must thou go with me to hell.</p>

<p><i>Adam</i> [<i>aside</i>]. I have a policy to shift him, for I
know he comes out of a hot place, and I know myself,
the smith and the devil hath a dry tooth in his head:

<p><i>Adam.</i> Faith, sir, my old friend, and now goodman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
devil, you know you and I have been tossing many a
good cup of ale: your nose is grown very rich: what
say you, will you take a pot of ale now at my hands?
Hell is like a smith's forge, full of water, and yet ever
athirst.</p>

get upon my back, that I may carry thee.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> You know I am a smith, sir: let me look
whether you be well shod or no; for if you want a shoe,
a remove, or the clinching of a nail, I am at your
command.</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> Thou hast never a shoe fit for me.</p>

<p><i>Adam,</i> Why, sir, we shoe horned beasts, as well as you,&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
O good Lord! let me sit down and laugh; hath
never a cloven foot; a devil, quoth he! I'll use <i>Spritus
santus</i> nor <i>Nominus patrus</i> no more to him, I warrant
you; I'll do more good upon him with my cudgel: now
will I sit me down, and become justice of peace to the
devil.</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> Come, art thou ready?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> I am ready, and with this cudgel I will conjure
thee. [<i>Beats him.</i></p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> O, hold thy hand! thou killest me, thou
killest me! [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Then may I count myself, I think, a tall<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
man, that am able to kill a devil. Now who dare deal
with me in the parish? or what wench in Nineveh will
not love me, when they say, "There goes he that beat
the devil?" [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Rasni.</i> So, viceroys, you have pleas'd me passing well;<br />
These curious cates are gracious in mine eye,<br />
But these borachios of the richest wine<br />
Make me to think how blithesome we will be.&mdash;<br />
Seat thee, fair Juno, in the royal throne,<br />
And I will serve thee to see thy face,<br />
That, feeding on the beauty of thy looks,<br />
My stomach and mine eyes may both be fill'd.&mdash;<br />
Come, lordings, seat you, fellow-mates at feast,<br />
And frolic, wags; this is a day of glee:<br />
This banquet is for brightsome Alvida.<br />
I'll have them skink<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> my standing bowls with wine,<br />

For whoso riseth from this feast not drunk,<br />
As I am Rasni, Nineveh's great king,<br />
Shall die the death as traitor to myself,<br />
For that he scorns the health of Alvida.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cil.</i> That will I never do, my lord;<br />
Therefore with favour, fortune to your grace,<br />
Carouse unto the health of Alvida.<br />
<br />

And, Crete, to thee a bowl of Greekish wine,<br />
Here to the health of Alvida.<br />

A pledge unto the health of heavenly Alvida.<br />

Drink you, I say, unto my lover's health:<br />
Let none that is in Rasni's royal court<br />
Go this night safe and sober to his bed.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adam.</i> This way he is, and here will I speak with
him.</p>

<p><i>First Lord.</i> Fellow, whither pressest thou?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> I press nobody, sir; I am going to speak with
a friend of mine.</p>

<p><i>First Lord.</i> Why, slave, here is none but the king, and
his viceroys.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> The king! marry, sir, he is the man I would
speak withal.</p>

<p><i>First Lord.</i> Why, callest him a friend of thine?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Ay, marry, do I, sir; for if he be not my friend,
I'll make him my friend, ere he and I pass.</p>

<p><i>First Lord.</i> Away, vassal, begone! thou speak unto
the king!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Ay, marry, will I, sir; an if he were a king of
velvet, I will talk to him.</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> What's the matter there? what noise is that?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> A boon, my liege, a boon, my liege!</p>

<p>
<i>Rasni.</i> What is it that great Rasni will not grant,<br />
This day, unto the meanest of his land,<br />
In honour of his beauteous Alvida?<br />
Come hither, swain; what is it that thou cravest?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Faith, sir, nothing, but to speak a few sentences
to your worship.</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> Say, what is it?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> I am sure, sir, you have heard of the spirits
that walk in the city here.</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> Ay, what of that?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Truly, sir, I have an oration to tell you of one
of them; and this it is.</p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> Why goest not forward with thy tale?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Faith, mistress, I feel an imperfection in my
voice, a disease that often troubles me; but, alas, easily
mended; a cup of ale or a cup of wine will serve the turn.</p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> Fill him a bowl, and let him want no drink.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> O, what a precious word was that, "And let
him want no drink!" [<i>Drink given to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] Well,
sir, now I'll tell you forth my tale. Sir, as I was
coming alongst the port-royal of Nineveh, there appeared
to me a great devil, and as hard-favoured a devil
as ever I saw; nay, sir, he was a cuckoldly devil,
for he had horns on his head. This devil, mark you
now, presseth upon me, and, sir, indeed, I charged him
with my pike-staff; but when that would not serve, I
came upon him with <i>Spritus santus</i>,&mdash;why, it had been
able to have put Lucifer out of his wits: when I saw my
charm would not serve, I was in such a perplexity, that
sixpenny-worth of juniper would not have made the
place sweet again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> Why, fellow, wert thou so afraid?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> O, mistress, had you been there and seen, his
very sight had made you shift a clean smock! I promise
you, though I were a man, and counted a tall fellow, yet
my laundress called me slovenly knave the next day.</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> A pleasant slave.&mdash;Forward, sirrah, on with
thy tale.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Faith, sir, but I remember a word that my
mistress your bed-fellow spoke.</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> What was that, fellow?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> O, sir, a word of comfort, a precious word&mdash;"And
let him want no drink."</p>

<p><i>Rasni.</i> Her word is law; and thou shalt want no
drink. [<i>Drink given to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Then, sir, this devil came upon me, and would
not be persuaded, but he would needs carry me to hell.
I proffered him a cup of ale, thinking, because he came
out of so hot a place, that he was thirsty; but the devil
was not dry, and therefore the more sorry was I. Well,
there was no remedy but I must with him to hell: and
at last I cast mine eye aside; if you knew what I spied
you would laugh, sir; I looked from top to toe, and he
had no cloven feet. Then I ruffled up my hair, and set
my cap on the one side, and, sir, grew to be a justice of
peace to the devil: at last in a great fume, as I am very
choleric, and sometimes so hot in my fustian fumes that
no man can abide within twenty yards of me, I start up,
and so bombasted the devil, that, sir, he cried out and
ran away.</p>

<p>
<i>Alvi.</i> This pleasant knave hath made me laugh my fill.<br />
Rasni, now Alvida begins her quaff,<br />
And drinks a full carouse unto her king.<br />
<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> A pledge, my love, as hearty as great Jove<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Drunk when his Juno heav'd a bowl to him.&mdash;<br />

Ply it till every man hath ta'en his load.&mdash;<br />
How now, sirrah, what cheer? we have no words of you.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Truly, sir, I was in a brown study about my
mistress.</p>

<p><i>Alvi.</i> About me! for what?</p>

<p><i>Adam,</i> Truly, mistress, to think what a golden sentence
you did speak: all the philosophers in the world could
not have said more:&mdash;"What, come, let him want no
drink." O, wise speech!</p>

<p>
<i>Alvi.</i> Villains, why skink you unto this fellow?<br />
He makes me blithe and merry in my thoughts:<br />
Heard you not that the king hath given command,<br />
That all be drunk this day within his court<br />
In quaffing to the health of Alvida?<br />

<br />
<i>Rasni.</i> What fellow's this, that thus disturbs our feast<br />
With outcries and alarums to repent?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> O sir, 'tis one Goodman Jonas, that is come
from Jericho; and surely I think he hath seen some
spirit by the way, and is fallen out of his wits, for he
never leaves crying night nor day. My master heard
him, and he shut up his shop, gave me my indenture,
and he and his wife do nothing but fast and pray.</p>

comest thou?</p>

<p>

Sent hither by the mighty God of hosts,<br />

My life hath been a loadstar unto them,<br />
To guide them in the labyrinth of blame:<br />
Thus I have taught them for to do amiss;<br />
Then must I weep, my friend, for their amiss.<br />
The fall of Nineveh is wrought by me:<br />
I have maintain'd this city in her shame;<br />
I have contemn'd the warnings from above;<br />
I have upholden incest, rape, and spoil;<br />
'Tis I, that wrought the sin, must weep the sin.<br />
O, had I tears like to the silver streams<br />
That from the Alpine mountains sweetly stream,<br />
Or had I sighs, the treasures of remorse,<br />
As plentiful as Æolus hath blasts,<br />
I then would tempt the heavens with my laments,<br />
And pierce the throne of mercy by my sighs!<br />

That Nineveh shall quite be overthrown;<br />
This is the day of horror and mishap,<br />
Fatal unto the cursèd Ninevites.<br />
These stately towers shall in thy watery bounds,<br />
Swift-flowing Lycus, find their burials:<br />
These palaces, the pride of Assur's kings,<br />
Shall be the bowers of desolation,<br />
Whereas the solitary bird shall sing,<br />
And tigers train their young ones to their nest.<br />
O all ye nations bounded by the west,<br />
Ye happy isles where prophets do abound,<br />
Ye cities famous in the western world,<br />
Make Nineveh a precedent for you!<br />
Leave lewd desires, leave covetous delights,<br />
Fly usury, let whoredom be exil'd,<br />
Lest you with Nineveh be overthrown.<br />
Lo, how the sun's inflamèd torch prevails,<br />
Scorching the parchèd furrows of the earth!<br />
Here will I sit me down, and fix mine eye<br />
Upon the ruins of yon wretched town;<br />
And, lo, a pleasant shade, a spreading vine,<br />
To shelter Jonas in this sunny heat!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>What means my God? the day is done and spent;<br />
Lord, shall my prophecy be brought to naught?<br />
When falls the fire? when will the judge be wroth?<br />
I pray thee, Lord, remember what I said,<br />
When I was yet within my country-land:<br />
Jehovah is too merciful, I fear.<br />
O, let me fly, before a prophet fault!<br />
For thou art merciful, the Lord my God,<br />
Full of compassion, and of sufferance,<br />
And dost repent in taking punishment.<br />
Why stays thy hand? O Lord, first take my life,<br />
Before my prophecy be brought to naught!<br />

Ah, he is wroth! behold, the gladsome vine,<br />

And heat prevails, and I am faint in heart.<br />

<p>
<i>Angel.</i> Art thou so angry, Jonas? tell me why.<br />
<br />
<i>Jonas.</i> Jehovah, I with burning heat am plung'd,<br />

Behold, a serpent hath devourèd it:<br />
And lo, the sun, incens'd by eastern wind,<br />
Afflicts me with canicular aspéct.<br />

'Twere better I were dead then rest alive.<br />

<br />

Or talk his praises with a fervent tongue?<br />
He bringeth down to hell, and lifts to heaven;<br />
He draws the yoke of bondage from the just,<br />
And looks upon the heathen with piteous eyes:<br />
To him all praise and honour be ascrib'd.<br />
O, who can tell the wonders of my God?<br />
He makes the infant to proclaim his truth,<br />
The ass to speak to save the prophet's life,<br />
The earth and sea to yield increase for man.<br />
Who can describe the compass of his power,<br />
Or testify in terms his endless might?<br />
My ravish'd sprite, O, whither dost thou wend?<br />
Go and proclaim the mercy of my God;<br />
Relieve the careful-hearted Ninevites;<br />
And, as thou wert the messenger of death,<br />
Go bring glad tidings of recover'd grace. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Within the City of Nineveh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, <i>with a bottle of beer in one slop,</i><a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> <i>and a great
piece of beef in another.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Well, Goodman Jonas, I would you had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
come from Jewry to this country; you have made me
look like a lean rib of roast beef, or like the picture
of Lent painted upon a red-herring's cob.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Alas,
masters, we are commanded by the proclamation to
fast and pray! by my troth, I could prettily so-so away
with<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> praying; but for fasting, why, 'tis so contrary to my
nature, that I had rather suffer a short hanging than a
long fasting. Mark me, the words be these, "Thou shalt
take no manner of food for so many days." I had as
lief he should have said, "Thou shalt hang thyself for
so many days." And yet, in faith, I need not find fault
with the proclamation, for I have a buttery and a pantry
and a kitchen about me; for proof, <i>ecce signum!</i> this
right slop is my pantry, behold a manchet<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> [<i>Draws it out</i>];
this place is my kitchen, for, lo, a piece of beef [<i>Draws
it out</i>],&mdash;O, let me repeat that sweet word again! "for,
lo, a piece of beef." This is my buttery, for, see, see,
my friends, to my great joy, a bottle of beer [<i>Draws it
out</i>]. Thus, alas, I make shift to wear out this fasting;
I drive away the time. But there go searchers about
to seek if any man breaks the king's command. O, here
they be; in with your victuals, Adam.
[<i>Puts them back into his slops.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter Two</i> Searchers.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Search.</i> How duly the men of Nineveh keep the
proclamation! how are they armed to repentance! We
have searched through the whole city, and have not as
yet found one that breaks the fast.</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> The sign of the more grace:&mdash;but stay,
here sits one, methinks, at his prayers; let us see who
it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> 'Tis Adam, the smith's man.&mdash;How now,
Adam?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Trouble me not; "Thou shalt take no manner
of food, but fast and pray."</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> How devoutly he sits at his orisons! but
stay, methinks I feel a smell of some meat or bread about
him.</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> So thinks me too.&mdash;You, sirrah, what
victuals have you about you?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Victuals! O horrible blasphemy! Hinder me
not of my prayer, nor drive me not into a choler.
Victuals! why, heardest thou not the sentence, "Thou
shalt take no food, but fast and pray"?</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> Truth, so it should be; but, methinks, I
smell meat about thee.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> About me, my friends! these words are actions
in the case. About me! no, no, hang those gluttons
that cannot fast and pray.</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> Well, for all your words, we must search you.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Search me! take heed what you do; my hose<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
are my castles, 'tis burglary if you break ope a slop; no
officer must lift up an iron hatch; take heed, my slops
are iron.
[<i>They search</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> O villain!&mdash;see how he hath gotten
victuals, bread, beef, and beer, where the king commanded
upon pain of death none should eat for so many
days, no, not the sucking infant!</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Alas, sir, this is nothing but a <i>modicum non nocet
ut medicus daret</i>; why, sir, a bit to comfort my stomach.</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> Villain, thou shalt be hanged for it.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> These are your words, "I shall be hanged for
it"; but first answer me to this question, how many days
have we to fast still?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> Five days.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Five days! a long time: then I must be
hanged?</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> Ay, marry, must thou.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> I am your man, I am for you, sir, for I had
rather be hanged than abide so long a fast. What, five
days! Come, I'll untruss. Is your halter, and the
gallows, the ladder, and all such furniture in readiness?</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> I warrant thee, shalt want none of these.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> But hear you, must I be hanged?</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> Ay, marry.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> And for eating of meat. Then, friends, know
ye by these presents, I will eat up all my meat, and drink
up all my drink, for it shall never be said, I was hanged
with an empty stomach.</p>

<p><i>First Search.</i> Come away, knave; wilt thou stand
feeding now?</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> If you be so hasty, hang yourself an hour,
while I come to you, for surely I will eat up my meat.</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> Come, let's draw him away perforce.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> You say there is five days yet to fast; these
are your words?</p>

<p><i>Sec. Search.</i> Ay, sir.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> I am for you: come, let's away, and yet let me
be put in the Chronicles. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>


<p>Two quartos of <i>Orlando Furioso</i> are known. Of these, copies of
the first, dated 1594, printed by John Danter for Cuthbert Burby,
are to be found in the British Museum and in the Dyce Library at
South Kensington; copies of the second, dated 1599, and printed by
Simon Stafford for Cuthbert Burby, are to be found in the British
Museum, the Dyce Library and the library of Mr Huth. On the
<i>Stationers' Registers</i> the play is entered, 7th December 1593, to
John Danter, and notice of transfer to Cuthbert Burby is made
under date of 28th May 1594. The play belonged first to the
Queen's players and was probably performed at court, possibly on
St. Stephen's Day, 26th December 1588, though this is conjecture
(<i>See</i> Cayley, <i>Rep. Eng. Com.</i>, p 409). Upon the absence of the
Queen's men from court, 26th December 1591 to April 1593, this
play, among others, fell into the hands of the combined Admiral's
and Strange's companies, and was by them performed, as Henslowe
records, 21st February 1592. Greene's name does not appear on
the title-page of the quartos. In <i>The Defence of Conny-Catching</i>
(1592), we find the following.&mdash;"Master R. G., would it not make
you blush&mdash;if you sold <i>Orlando Furioso</i> to the Queen's players for
twenty nobles, and when they were in the country, sold the same
play to Lord Admiral's men, for as much more? Was not this
plain coney-catching, M. G.?" Among the actors in the Admiral
and Strange companies was Edward Alleyn. It so occurs that
there exists at Dulwich College a large portion of the MS. of this
play, containing the part of Orlando, with cues regularly marked,
and with omissions supplied in the handwriting of Alleyn.
Though imperfect, this MS. indicates that the printed edition was
composed from a curtailed and mutilated copy. Greene's play is
based on a free use of Ariosto, and may be considered a parody on
the "mad plays" popular at the time. Reflections of it are to be
found in Peele's <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>, in the name Sacripant, and in the
resemblance between ll. 66-69, <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and ll. 885-888,
<i>Old Wives' Tale</i>.</p>

And let her censure<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> make the happiest man.<br />
<br />
<i>Sold.</i> The fairest flower that glories Africa,<br />
Whose beauty Phœbus dares not dash with showers,<br />
Over whose climate never hung a cloud,<br />
But smiling Titan lights the horizon,&mdash;<br />
Egypt is mine, and there I hold my state,<br />
Seated in Cairo and in Babylon.<br />
From thence the matchless beauty of Angelica,<br />
Whose hue (as bright as are those silver doves<br />
That wanton Venus mann'th<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> upon her fist),<br />
Forc'd me to cross and cut th' Atlantic seas,<br />
To oversearch the fearful ocean,<br />
Where I arriv'd to etérnize with my lance<br />
The matchless beauty of fair Angelica;<br />
Nor tilt, nor tourney, but my spear and shield<br />
Resounding on their crests and sturdy helms,<br />
Topt high with plumes, like Mars his burgonet,<br />
Enchasing on their curats<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> with my blade,<br />
That none so fair as fair Angelica.<br />
But leaving these such glories as they be,<br />
I love, my lord; let that suffice for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Rod.</i> Cuba my seat, a region so enrich'd<br />
With savours sparkling from the smiling heavens,<br />
As those that seek for traffic to my coast<br />
Account it like that wealthy Paradise<br />
From whence floweth Gihon, and swift Euphrates:<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a><br />
The earth within her bowels hath enwrapt,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>As in the massy storehouse of the world,<br />
Millions of gold, as bright as was the shower<br />
That wanton Jove sent down to Danaë.<br />
Marching from thence to manage arms abroad,<br />
I pass'd the triple-parted regiment<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a><br />
That froward Saturn gave unto his sons,<br />
Erecting statues of my chivalry,<br />
Such and so brave as never Hercules<br />
Vow'd for the love of lovely Iole.<br />
But leaving these such glories as they be,<br />
I love, my lord; let that suffice for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> And I, my lord, am Mandricard of Mexico,<br />
Whose climate, fairer than Iberia's,<br />
Seated beyond the sea of Tripoly,<br />
And richer than the plot Hesperides,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a><br />
Or that same isle wherein Ulysses' love<br />
Lull'd in her lap the young Telegonus;<br />
That did but Venus tread a dainty step,<br />
So would she like the land of Mexico,<br />
As, Paphos and brave Cyprus set aside,<br />
With me sweet lovely Venus would abide.<br />
From thence, mounted upon a Spanish bark,<br />
Such as transported Jason to the fleece,<br />
Come from the south, I furrow'd Neptune's seas,<br />
North-east as far as is the frozen Rhine;<br />
Leaving fair Voya, cross'd up Danuby,<br />
As high as Saba, whose enhancing streams<br />
Cut 'twixt the Tartars and the Russians:<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><br />
There did I act as many brave attempts,<br />
As did Pirothous for his Proserpine.<br />
But leaving these such glories as they be,<br />
I love, my lord; let that suffice for me.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><i>Brand.</i> The bordering islands, seated here in ken,<br />
Whose shores are sprinkled with rich orient pearl,<br />

That overpeer the bright and golden shore,<br />
Than do the rubbish of my country seas:<br />
And what I dare, let say the Portingale,<br />
And Spaniard tell, who, mann'd with mighty fleets,<br />
Came to subdue my islands to their king,<br />
Filling our seas with stately argosies,<br />
Carvels and magars, hulks of burden great,<br />
Which Brandimart rebated<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> from his coast,<br />

But leaving these such glories as they be,<br />
I love, my lord; let that suffice for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Lords of the south, and princes of esteem,<br />
Viceroys unto the state of Africa,<br />
I am no king, yet am I princely born,<br />
Descended from the royal house of France,<br />
And nephew to the mighty Charlemagne,<br />
Surnam'd Orlando, the County Palatine.<br />
Swift fame hath sounded to our western seas<br />
The matchless beauty of Angelica,<br />
Fairer than was the nymph of Mercury,<br />
Who, when bright Phœbus mounteth up his coach,<br />
And tracts Aurora in her silver steps,<br />
And sprinkles from the folding of her lap<br />
White lilies, roses, and sweet violets.<br />
Yet thus believe me, princes of the south,<br />
Although my country's love, dearer than pearl<br />
Or mines of gold, might well have kept me back;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>The sweet conversing with my king and friends,<br />
Left all for love, might well have kept me back;<br />
The seas by Neptune hoisèd to the heavens,<br />
Whose dangerous flaws<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> might well have kept me back;<br />
The savage Moors and Anthropophagi,<br />
Whose lands I pass'd, might well have kept me back;<br />
The doubt of entertainment in the court<br />
When I arriv'd, might well have kept me back;<br />
But so the fame of fair Angelica<br />
Stamp'd in my thoughts the figure of her love,<br />
As neither country, king, or seas, or cannibals,<br />
Could by despairing keep Orlando back.<br />
I list not boast in acts of chivalry<br />
(An humour never fitting with my mind),<br />
But come there forth the proudest champion<br />
That hath suspicion in the Palatine,<br />
And with my trusty sword Durandell,<br />
Single, I'll register upon his helm<br />
What I dare do for fair Angelica.<br />
But leaving these such glories as they be,<br />
I love, my lord;<br />
Angelica herself shall speak for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Daughter, thou hear'st what love hath here alleg'd,<br />
How all these kings, by beauty summon'd here,<br />
Put in their pleas, for hope of diadem,<br />
Of noble deeds, of wealth, and chivalry,<br />
All hoping to possess Angelica.<br />
Sith father's will may hap to aim amiss<br />
(For parents' thoughts in love oft step awry),<br />
Choose thou the man who best contenteth thee,<br />
And he shall wear the Afric crown next me.<br />
For trust me, daughter, like of whom thou please.<br />
Thou satisfied, my thoughts shall be at ease.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span><i>Ang.</i> Kings of the South, viceroys of Africa,<br />
Sith father's will hangs on his daughter's choice,<br />
And I, as erst Princess Andromache<br />
Seated amidst the crew of Priam's sons,<br />
Have liberty to choose where best I love;<br />
Must freely say, for fancy hath no fraud,<br />
That far unworthy is Angelica<br />
Of such as deign to grace her with their loves;<br />
The Soldan with his seat in Babylon,<br />
The Prince of Cuba, and of Mexico,<br />
Whose wealthy crowns might win a woman's will,<br />
Young Brandimart, master of all the isles<br />
Where Neptune planted hath his treasury:<br />
The worst of these men of so high import<br />
As may command a greater dame than I.<br />
But fortune, or some deep-inspiring fate,<br />
Venus, or else the bastard brat of Mars,<br />
Whose bow commands the motions of the mind,<br />
Hath sent proud love to enter such a plea<br />
As nonsuits all your princely evidence,<br />
And flat commands that, maugre majesty,<br />
I choose Orlando, County Palatine.<br />
<br />
<i>Rod.</i> How likes Marsilius of his daughter's choice?<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> As fits Marsilius of his daughter's spouse.<br />
<br />
<i>Rod.</i> Highly thou wrong'st us, King of Africa,<br />
To brave thy neighbour princes with disgrace,<br />
To tie thine honour to thy daughter's thoughts,<br />
Whose choice is like that Greekish giglot's<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> love<br />
That left her lord, Prince Menelaus,<br />
And with a swain made 'scape away to Troy.<br />
What is Orlando but a straggling mate,<br />
Banish'd for some offence by Charlemagne,<br />
Skipp'd from his country as Anchises' son,<br />
And means, as he did to the Carthage Queen,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>To pay her ruth and ruin for her love?<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Injurious Cuba, ill it fits thy gree<br />
To wrong a stranger with discourtesy.<br />
Were't not the sacred presence of Angelica<br />
Prevails with me, as Venus' smiles with Mars,<br />
To set a supersedeas of my wrath,<br />
Soon should I teach thee what it were to brave.<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> And, Frenchman, were't not 'gainst the law of arms,<br />
In place of parley for to draw a sword,<br />
Untaught companion, I would learn you know<br />
What duty 'longs to such a prince as he.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Then as did Hector 'fore Achilles' tent,<br />
Trotting his courser softly on the plains,<br />
Proudly dar'd forth the stoutest youth of Greece;<br />
So who stands highest in his own conceit,<br />
And thinks his courage can perform the most,<br />
Let him but throw his gauntlet on the ground,<br />
And I will pawn my honour to his gage,<br />
He shall ere night be met and combated.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Shame you not, princes, at this bad agree,<br />
To wrong a stranger with discourtesy?<br />
Believe me, lords, my daughter hath made choice,<br />
And, maugre him that thinks him most aggriev'd,<br />
She shall enjoy the County Palatine.<br />
<br />
<i>Brand.</i> But would these princes follow my advice,<br />
And enter arms as did the Greeks 'gainst Troy,<br />
Nor he, nor thou should'st have Angelica.<br />
<br />
<i>Rod.</i> Let him be thought a dastard to his death,<br />
That will not sell the travails he hath past<br />
Dearer than for a woman's fooleries:<br />
What says the mighty Mandricard?<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> I vow to hie me home to Mexico,<br />
To troop myself with such a crew of men<br />
As shall so fill the downs of Africa<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>Like to the plains of watery Thessaly,<br />
Whenas an eastern gale, whistling aloft,<br />
Hath overspread the ground with grasshoppers.<br />
Then see, Marsilius, if the Palatine<br />
Can keep his love from falling to our lots,<br />
Or thou canst keep thy country free from spoil.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Why, think you, lords, with haughty menaces<br />
To dare me out within my palace-gates?<br />
Or hope you to make conquest by constraint<br />
Of that which never could be got by love?<br />
Pass from my court, make haste out of my land,<br />
Stay not within the bounds Marsilius holds;<br />
Lest, little brooking these unfitting braves,<br />
My choler overslip the law of arms,<br />
And I inflict revenge on such abuse.<br />
<br />
<i>Rod.</i> I'll beard and brave thee in thy proper town,<br />
And here ensconce myself despite of thee,<br />
And hold thee play till Mandricard return.&mdash;<br />
What says the mighty Soldan of Egýpt?<br />
<br />
<i>Sold.</i> That when Prince Menelaus with all his mates<br />
Had ten years held their siege in Asia,<br />
Folding their wraths in cinders of fair Troy,<br />
Yet, for their arms grew by conceit of love,<br />
Their trophies were but conquest of a girl:<br />
Then trust me, lords, I'll never manage arms<br />
For women's loves that are so quickly lost.<br />
<br />
<i>Brand.</i> Tush, my lords, why stand you upon terms?<br />
Let us to our sconce,&mdash;and you, my lord, to Mexico.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Ay, sirs, ensconce ye how you can,<br />
See what we dare, and thereon set your rest.<br />
[<i>Exeunt all except</i> <span class="smcap">Sacripant</span> <i>and his</i> Man.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Boast not too much, Marsilius, in thyself,<br />
Nor of contentment in Angelica;<br />
For Sacripant must have Angelica,<br />
And with her Sacripant must have the crown:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>By hook or crook I must and will have both.<br />
Ah sweet Revenge, incense their angry minds,<br />
Till, all these princes weltering in their bloods,<br />
The crown do fall to County Sacripant!<br />
Sweet are the thoughts that smother from conceit:<br />
For when I come and set me down to rest,<br />
My chair presents a throne of majesty;<br />
And when I set my bonnet on my head,<br />
Methinks I fit my forehead for a crown;<br />
And when I take my truncheon in my fist,<br />
A sceptre then comes tumbling in my thoughts;<br />
My dreams are princely, all of diadems.<br />
Honour,&mdash;methinks the title is too base:<br />
Mighty, glorious, and excellent,&mdash;ay, these,<br />
My glorious genius, sound within my mouth;<br />
These please the ear, and with a sweet applause,<br />
Make me in terms coequal with the gods.<br />
Then these, Sacripant, and none but these;<br />
And these, or else make hazard of thy life.<br />
Let it suffice, I will conceal the rest.&mdash;<br />
Sirrah!<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> My lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. My lord! How basely was this slave brought up,<br />
That knows no titles fit for dignity,<br />
To grace his master with hyperboles!<br />
My lord! Why, the basest baron of fair Africa<br />
Deserves as much: yet County Sacripant<br />
Must he a swain salute with name of lord.&mdash;<br />
Sirrah, what thinks the Emperor of my colours,<br />
Because in field I wear both blue and red at once?<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> They deem, my lord, your honour lives at peace,<br />
As one that's neuter in these mutinies,<br />
And covets to rest equal friends to both;<br />
Neither envious to Prince Mandricard,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>Nor wishing ill unto Marsilius,<br />
That you may safely pass where'er you please,<br />
With friendly salutations from them both.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Ay, so they guess, but level far awry;<br />
For if they knew the secrets of my thoughts,<br />
Mine emblem sorteth to another sense.<br />
I wear not these as one resolv'd to peace,<br />
But blue and red as enemy to both;<br />
Blue, as hating King Marsilius,<br />
And red, as in revenge to Mandricard:<br />
Foe unto both, friend only to myself,<br />
And to the crown, for that's the golden mark<br />
Which makes my thoughts dream on a diadem.<br />
See'st not thou all men presage I shall be king?<br />
Marsilius sends to me for peace;<br />
Mandricard puts off his cap, ten mile off:<br />
Two things more, and then I cannot miss the crown.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> O, what be those, my good lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> First must I get the love of fair Angelica.<br />
Now am I full of amorous conceits,<br />
Not that I doubt to have what I desire,<br />
But how I might best with mine honour woo:<br />
Write, or entreat,&mdash;fie, that fitteth not;<br />
Send by ambassadors,&mdash;no, that's too base;<br />
Flatly command,&mdash;ay, that's for Sacripant:<br />
Say thou art Sacripant, and art in love,<br />
And who in Africa dare say the county nay?<br />
O Angelica,<br />
Fairer than Chloris when in all her pride<br />
Bright Maia's son entrapp'd her in the net<br />
Wherewith Vulcan entangled the god of war!<br />
</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Your honour is so far in contemplation of
Angelica as you have forgot the second in attaining to
the crown.</p>

<p><i>Sac.</i> That's to be done by poison, prowess, or any
means of treachery, to put to death the traitorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Orlando.&mdash;But who is this comes here? Stand close.

him to be as full of prowess as policy, and fearing lest
in leaning to the other faction he might greatly prejudice
them, they seek first to hold the candle before the devil,

lettuce fit for his lips. Now, sir, knowing his astronomical
humours, as one that gazeth so high at the stars as he
never looketh on the pavement in the streets,&mdash;but whist!

thyself a catalogue of privy conspiracies, what art thou?</p>

<p><i>Sac.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. My majesty!&mdash;Come hither, my well-nutrimented
knave; whom takest me to be?</p>

<p><i>Org.</i> The mighty Mandricard of Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Sac.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. I hold these salutations as ominous; for
saluting me by that which I am not, he presageth what
I shall be: for so did the Lacedæmonians by Agathocles,
who of a base potter wore the kingly diadem.&mdash;But why
deemest thou me to be the mighty Mandricard of Mexico?</p>

<p><i>Org.</i> Marry, sir,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sac.</i> Stay there: wert thou never in France?</p>

<p><i>Org.</i> Yes, if it please your majesty.</p>

<p><i>Sac.</i> So it seems, for there they salute their king by
the name of Sir, Monsieur:&mdash;but forward.</p>

From those looks flame, like lightning from the east,<br />

To be heroical:&mdash;but say, to whom art thou sent?<br />

Marsilius, together with his daughter Angelica and

<p><i>Org.</i> There, my good lord.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><i>Ang.</i> Well, that my lord so friendly is in league,<br />
As honour wills him, with Marsilius.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Angelica, shall I have a word or two with thee?<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> What pleaseth my lord for to command?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Then know, my love, I cannot paint my grief,<br />
Nor tell a tale of Venus and her son,<br />
Reporting such a catalogue of toys:<br />
It fits not Sacripant to be effeminate.<br />
Only give leave, my fair Angelica,<br />
To say, the county is in love with thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> Pardon, my lord; my loves are over-past:<br />
So firmly is Orlando printed in my thoughts,<br />
As love hath left no place for any else.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Why, overweening damsel, see'st thou not<br />
Thy lawless love unto this straggling mate<br />
Hath fill'd our Afric regions full of blood?<br />
And wilt thou still perséver in thy love?<br />
Tush, leave the Palatine, and go with me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> Brave county, know, where sacred love unites,<br />
The knot of gordian at the shrine of Jove<br />
Was never half so hard or intricate<br />
As be the bands which lovely Venus ties.<br />
Sweet is my love; and, for I love, my lord,<br />
Seek not, unless as Alexander did,<br />
To cut the plough-swain's traces with thy sword,<br />
Or slice the slender fillets of my life:<br />
For else, my lord, Orlando must be mine.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Stand I on love? Stoop I to Venus' lure,<br />
That never yet did fear the god of war?<br />
Shall men report that County Sacripant<br />
Held lovers' pains for pining passions?<br />
Shall such a siren offer me more wrong<br />
Than they did to the prince of Ithaca?<br />
No; as he his ears, so, county, stop thine eye.<br />
Go to your needle, lady, and your clouts;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>Go to such milksops as are fit for love:<br />
I will employ my busy brains for war.<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> Let not, my lord, denial breed offence:<br />
Love doth allow her favours but to one,<br />
Nor can there sit within the sacred shrine<br />
Of Venus more than one installèd heart.<br />
Orlando is the gentleman I love,<br />
And more than he may not enjoy my love.<br />

Have ever been heroical and brave?<br />
Stand you in dumps, like to the Myrmidon<br />
Trapt in the tresses of Polyxena,<br />
Who, amid the glory of his chivalry,<br />
Sat daunted with a maid of Asia?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Thinkst thou my thoughts are lunacies of love?<br />
No, they are brands firèd in Pluto's forge,<br />
Where sits Tisiphone tempering in flames<br />
Those torches that do set on fire revenge.<br />
I lov'd the dame; but brav'd by her repulse,<br />
Hate calls me on to quittance all my ills;<br />
Which first must come by offering prejudice<br />
Unto Orlando her belovèd love.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> O, how may that be brought to pass, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Thus. Thou see'st that Medor and Angelica<br />
Are still so secret in their private walks,<br />
As that they trace the shady lawnds,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>And thickest-shadow'd groves,<br />
Which well may breed suspicion of some love.<br />
Now, than the French no nation under heaven<br />
Is sooner touch'd with sting of jealousy.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> And what of that, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Hard by, for solace, in a secret grove,<br />
The county once a-day fails not to walk:<br />
There solemnly he ruminates his love.<br />
Upon those shrubs that compass-in the spring,<br />
And on those trees that border-in those walks,<br />
I'll slily have engrav'n on every bark<br />
The names of Medor and Angelica.<br />
Hard by, I'll have some roundelays hung up,<br />
Wherein shall be some posies of their loves,<br />
Fraughted so full of fiery passions<br />
As that the county shall perceive by proof<br />
Medor hath won his fair Angelica.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Is this all, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> No; for thou like to a shepherd shalt be cloth'd,<br />
With staff and bottle, like some country-swain<br />
That tends his flocks feeding upon these downs.<br />
Here see thou buzz into the county's ears<br />
That thou hast often seen within these woods<br />
Base Medor sporting with Angelica;<br />
And when he hears a shepherd's simple tale,<br />
He will not think 'tis feign'd.<br />
Then either a madding mood will end his love,<br />
Or worse betide him through fond jealousy.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Excellent, my lord; see how I will play the shepherd.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> And mark thou how I play the carver:<br />
Therefore be gone, and make thee ready straight.<br />

turning of the spit, and he comes in, and bade me fetch
him some drink. Now, I went and fetched him some;

the roast-meat, spit and all, and so we had nothing but
porridge to dinner.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Camp of the</i> Twelve Peers of France.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Twelve Peers of France, <i>with drum and
trumpets.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>
<i>Ogier.</i> Brave peers of France, sith we have pass'd the bounds,<br />
Whereby the wrangling billows seek for straits<br />
To war with Tellus, and her fruitful mines;<br />
Sith we have furrow'd through those wandering tides<br />
Of Tyrrhene seas, and made our galleys dance<br />
Upon the Hyperborean billows' crests,<br />
That brave with streams the watery occident;<br />
And found the rich and wealthy Indian clime,<br />
Sought-to by greedy minds for hurtful gold;<br />
Now let us seek to venge the lamp of France<br />
That lately was eclipsèd in Angelica;<br />
Now let us seek Orlando forth, our peer,<br />
Though from his former wits lately estrang'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>Yet famous in our favours as before;<br />
And, sith by chance we all encounter'd be,<br />
Let's seek revenge on her that wrought his wrong.<br />
<br />
<i>Namus.</i> But being thus arriv'd in place unknown,<br />
Who shall direct our course unto the court<br />
Where brave Marsilius keeps his royal state?<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Lo, here, two Indian palmers hard at hand,<br />
Who can perhaps resolve our hidden doubts.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marsilius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mandricard</span> <i>like Palmers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
Palmers, God speed.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Lordings, we greet you well.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Where lies Marsilius' court, friend, canst thou tell?<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> His court's his camp; the prince is now in arms.<br />
<br />
<i>Turpin.</i> In arms! What's he that dares annoy so great a king?<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> Such as both love and fury do confound:<br />
Fierce Sacripant, incens'd with strange desires,<br />
Wars on Marsilius, and, Rodomont being dead,<br />
Hath levied all his men, and traitor-like<br />
Assails his lord and loving sovereign:<br />
And Mandricard, who late hath been in arms<br />
To prosecute revenge against Marsilius,<br />
Is now through favours past become his friend.<br />
Thus stands the state of matchless India.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Palmer, I like thy brave and brief discourse;<br />
And, couldst thou bring us to the prince's camp,<br />
We would acknowledge friendship at thy hands.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Ye stranger lords, why seek ye out Marsilius?<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> In hope that he, whose empire is so large,<br />
Will make both mind and monarchy agree.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Whence are you, lords, and what request you here?<br />
<br />
<i>Namus.</i> A question over-haughty for thy weed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Fit for the king himself for to propound.<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> O, sir, know that under simple weeds<br />
The gods have mask'd: then deem not with disdain<br />
To answer to this palmer's question,<br />
Whose coat includes perhaps as great as yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Haughty their words, their persons full of state;<br />
Though habit be but mean, their minds excel.&mdash;<br />
Well, palmers, know that princes are in India arriv'd,<br />
Yea, even those western princely peers of France<br />
That through the world adventures undertake,<br />
To find Orlando late incens'd with rage.<br />
Then, palmers, sith you know our styles and state,<br />
Advise us where your king Marsilius is.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Lordings of France, here is Marsilius,<br />
That bids you welcome into India,<br />
And will in person bring you to his camp.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Marsilius! and thus disguis'd!<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Even Marsilius, and thus disguis'd.<br />
But what request these princes at my hand?<br />
<br />
<i>Turpin.</i> We sue for law and justice at thy hand:<br />
We seek Angelica thy daughter out;<br />
That wanton maid, that hath eclips'd the joy<br />
Of royal France, and made Orlando mad.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> My daughter, lords! why, she is exil'd;<br />
And her griev'd father is content to lose<br />
The pleasance of his age, to countenance law.<br />
<br />
<i>Oliver.</i> Not only exile shall await Angelica,<br />
But death and bitter death shall follow her.<br />
Then yield us right, Marsilius, or our swords<br />
Shall make thee fear to wrong the peers of France.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Words cannot daunt me, princes, be assur'd;<br />
But law and justice shall o'er-rule in this,<br />
And I will bury father's name and love.<br />
The hapless maid, banish'd from out my land,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>Wanders about in woods and ways unknown:<br />
Her, if ye find, with fury persecute;<br />
I now disdain the name to be her father.<br />
Lords of France, what would you more of me?<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Marsilius, we commend thy princely mind,<br />
And will report thy justice through the world.&mdash;<br />
Come, peers of France, let's seek Angelica,<br />
Left for a spoil to our revenging thoughts. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

The shirt which Deianira sent to Hercules,<br />
To make me brave upon my wedding day,<br />
Tell him I'll pass the Alps, and up to Meroe,<br />

To see my slumbering dreams!<br />
Skies are fulfill'd with lamps of lasting joy,<br />
That boast the pride of haught Latona's son;<br />
He lighteneth all the candles of the night.<br />
Mnemosyne hath kiss'd the kingly Jove,<br />

Making her daughters'<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> solace on my brow.<br />
Methinks, I feel how Cynthia tunes conceits<br />
Of sad repeat, and melloweth those desires<br />
Which frenzy scarce had ripen'd in my head.<br />
Ate, I'll kiss thy restless cheek a while,<br />
And suffer fruitless passion bide control.<br />

More dreadful than appear'd to Hecuba,<br />
When fall of Troy was figur'd in her sleep!<br />
Juno, methought, sent down from heaven by Jove,<br />
Came swiftly sweeping through the gloomy air;<br />
And calling Iris, sent her straight abroad<br />
To summon Fauns, the Satyrs, and the Nymphs,<br />
The Dryads, and all the demigods,<br />
To secret council; [and, their] parle past,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a><br />
She gave them vials full of heavenly dew.<br />

<p><i>Org.</i> Like mad Orestes! nay, my lord, you may
boldly justify the comparison, for Orestes was never so
mad in his life as you were.</p>

freely speak.</p>

<p>
<i>Mel.</i> Time not affords to tell each circumstance:<br />

To sting thee with infecting jealousy:<br />
The swain that told thee of their oft converse,<br />
Was servant unto County Sacripant:<br />
And trust me, Orlando, Angelica,<br />
Though true to thee, is banish'd from the court<br />
And Sacripant this day bids battle to Marsilius.<br />
The armies ready are to give assail;<br />
And on a hill that overpeers them both<br />

Who are in quest to seek Orlando out.<br />

I am she that curèd thy disease.<br />
Here, take these weapons, given thee by the fates,<br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Battle-field.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<span class="smcap">Marsilius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mandricard</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Sac.</i> Viceroys, you are dead;<br />
For Sacripant, already crown'd a king,<br />
Heaves up his sword to have your diadems.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Traitor, not dead, nor any whit dismay'd;<br />
For dear we prize the smallest drop of blood.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Orlando</span> <i>with a scarf before his face.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Orl.</i> Stay, princes, 'base not yourselves to combat such a dog.<br />
Mount on your coursers, follow those that fly,<br />
And let your conquering swords be tainted in their bloods:<br />
Pass ye for him; he shall be combated.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Marsilius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mandricard</span>.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span><i>Sac.</i> Why, what art thou that brav'st me thus?<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> I am, thou see'st, a mercenary soldier,<br />
Homely attir'd, but of so haughty thoughts,<br />
As naught can serve to quench th' aspiring flames,<br />
That burn as do the fires of Sicily,<br />
Unless I win that princely diadem,<br />
That seems so ill upon thy coward's head.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Coward! To arms, sir boy! I will not brook these braves,<br />
If Mars himself, even from his fiery throne<br />
Came arm'd with all his furnitures of war.<br />
[<i>They fight, and</i> <span class="smcap">Sacripant</span> <i>falls.</i><br />
O villain! thou hast slain a prince.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Then mayst thou think that Mars himself came down,<br />
To vail thy plumes and heave thee from thy pomp.<br />
Proud that thou art, I reck not of thy gree,<br />
But I will have the conquest of my sword,<br />
Which is the glory of thy diadem.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> These words bewray thou art no base-born Moor,<br />
But by descent sprung from some royal line:<br />
Then freely tell me, what's thy name?<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Nay, first let me know thine.<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Then know that thou hast slain Prince Sacripant.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Sacripant! Then let me at thy dying day entreat,<br />
By that same sphere wherein thy soul shall rest,<br />
If Jove deny not passage to thy ghost,<br />
Thou tell me whether thou wrong'dst Angelica or no?<br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> O, that's the sting that pricks my conscience!<br />
O, that's the hell my thoughts abhor to think!<br />
I tell thee, knight, for thou dost seem no less,<br />
That I engrav'd the roundelays on the trees,<br />
And hung the schedules of poor Medor's love,<br />
Intending so to breed debate<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Between Orlando and Angelica:<br />
O, thus I wrong'd Orlando and Angelica!<br />
Now tell me, what shall I call thy name?<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Then dead is the fatal author of my ill.<br />
Base villain, vassal, unworthy of a crown,<br />
Know that the man that struck the fatal stroke<br />
Is Orlando, the County Palatine,<br />
Whom fortune sent to quittance all my wrongs.<br />
Thou foil'd and slain, it now behoves me straight<br />
To hie me fast to massacre thy men:<br />
And so, farewell, thou devil in shape of man. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Sac.</i> Hath Demogorgon, ruler of the fates,<br />
Set such a baleful period on my life<br />
As none might end the days of Sacripant<br />
But mighty Orlando, rival of my love?<br />
Now hold the fatal murderers of men<br />
The sharpen'd knife ready to cut my thread,<br />
Ending the scene of all my tragedy:<br />
This day, this hour, this minute ends the days<br />
Of him that liv'd worthy old Nestor's age.<br />
Phœbus, put on thy sable-suited wreath,<br />
Clad all thy spheres in dark and mourning weeds:<br />
Parch'd be the earth, to drink up every spring:<br />
Let corn and trees be blasted from above;<br />
Heaven turn to brass, and earth to wedge of steel;<br />
The world to cinders. Mars, come thundering down,<br />
And never sheath thy swift-revenging sword,<br />
Till, like the deluge in Deucalion's days,<br />
The highest mountains swim in streams of blood.<br />
Heaven, earth, men, beasts, and every living thing,<br />
Consume and end with County Sacripant! [<i>Dies.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The Camp of</i> <span class="smcap">Marsilius</span>.</h4>

<p>
<i>Mars.</i> Fought is the field, and Sacripant is slain,<br />
With such a massacre of all his men,<br />
As Mars, descending in his purple robe,<br />
Vows with Bellona in whole heaps of blood<br />
To banquet all the demigods of war.<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> See, where he lies slaughter'd without the camp,<br />
And by a simple swain, a mercenary,<br />
Who bravely took the combat to himself:<br />
Might I but know the man that did the deed,<br />
I would, my lord, etérnize him with fame.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Leaving the factious county to his death,<br />
Command, my lord, his body be convey'd<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a><br />
Unto some place, as likes your highness best.<br />
See, Marsilius, posting through Africa,<br />
We have found this straggling girl, Angelica,<br />
Who, for she wrong'd her love Orlando,<br />
Chiefest of the western peers, conversing<br />
With so mean a man as Medor was,<br />
We will have her punish'd by the laws of France,<br />
To end her burning lust in flames of fire.<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Beshrew you, lordings, but you do your worst;<br />
Fire, famine, and as cruel death<br />
As fell to Nero's mother in his rage.<br />
<br />
<i>Angelica.</i> Father, if I may dare to call thee so,<br />
And lords of France, come from the western seas,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>In quest to find mighty Orlando out,<br />
Yet, ere I die, let me have leave to say,<br />
Angelica held ever in her thoughts<br />
Most dear the love of County Palatine.<br />
What wretch hath wrong'd us with suspect of lust<br />
I know not, I, nor can accuse the man;<br />
But, by the heavens, whereto my soul shall fly,<br />
Angelica did never wrong Orlando.<br />
I speak not this as one that cares to live,<br />
For why my thoughts are fully malcontent;<br />
And I conjure you by your chivalry,<br />
You quit Orlando's wrong upon Angelica.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>, <i>with a scarf before his face.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Oliver.</i> Strumpet, fear not, for, by fair Maia's son,<br />
This day thy soul shall vanish up in fire,<br />
As Semele, when Juno wil'd the trull<br />
To entertain the glory of her love.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Frenchman, for so thy quaint array imports,<br />
Be thou a peer, or be thou Charlemagne,<br />
Or hadst thou Hector's or Achilles' heart,<br />
Or never-daunted thoughts of Hercules,<br />
That did in courage far surpass them all,<br />
I tell thee, sir, thou liest in thy throat,&mdash;<br />
The greatest brave Transalpine France can brook,&mdash;<br />
In saying that sacred Angelica<br />
Did offer wrong unto the Palatine.<br />
I am a common mercenary soldier;<br />
Yet, for I see my princess is abus'd<br />
By new-come stragglers from a foreign coast,<br />
I dare the proudest of these western lords<br />
To crack a blade in trial of her right.<br />
<br />
<i>Mand.</i> Why, foolish-hardy, daring, simple groom,<br />

Know'st thou to whom thou speak'st?<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> Brave soldier, for so much thy courage says,<br />
These men are princes, dipt within the blood<br />
Of kings most royal, seated in the west,<br />
Unfit to accept a challenge at your hand:<br />
Yet thanks that thou wouldst in thy lord's defence<br />
Fight for my daughter; but her guilt is known.<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> Ay, rest thee, soldier, Angelica is false,&mdash;<br />
False, for she hath no trial of her right:<br />
Soldier, let me die for the 'miss<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> of all.<br />
Wert thou as stout as was proud Theseus,<br />
In vain thy blade should offer my defence;<br />
For why these be the champions of the world,<br />
Twelve Peers of France that never yet were foil'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> How, madam, the Twelve Peers of France!<br />
Why, let them be twelve devils of hell,<br />
What I have said, I'll pawn my sword,<br />
To seal it on the shield of him that dares,<br />
Malgrado<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> of his honour, combat me.<br />

<br />
<i>Turpin.</i> Chastise the groom, Oliver, and learn him know<br />
We are not like the boys of Africa.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Hear you, sir? You that so peremptorily bade him fight,<br />
Prepare your weapons, for your turn is next:<br />
'Tis not one champion can discourage me.<br />
Come, are ye ready?<br />
[<i>He fights first with one, and then with the other,
and overcomes them both.</i><br />
So stand aside:&mdash;and, madam, if my fortune last it out,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>I'll guard your person with Twelve Peers of France.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. O Ogier, how canst thou stand, and see a slave<br />
Disgrace the house of France?&mdash;Sirrah, prepare you;<br />
For angry Nemesis sits on my sword to be reveng'd.<br />
[<i>They fight a good while, and then breathe.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> Howe'er disguis'd in base or Indian shape,<br />
Ogier can well discern thee by thy blows;<br />
For either thou art Orlando or the devil.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> [<i>taking off his scarf</i>].<br />
Then, to assure you that I am no devil,<br />
Here's your friend and companion, Orlando.<br />
<br />
<i>Ogier.</i> And none can be more glad than Ogier is,<br />
That he hath found his cousin in his sense.<br />
<br />
<i>Oliver.</i> Whenas I felt his blows upon my shield,<br />
My teeth did chatter, and my thoughts conceiv'd,<br />
Who might this be, if not the Palatine.<br />
<br />
<i>Turpin.</i> So had I said, but that report did tell<br />
My lord was troubled with a lunacy.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> So was I, lordings; but give me leave awhile,<br />
Humbly as Mars did to his paramour,<br />
So to submit to fair Angelica.&mdash;<br />
Pardon thy lord, fair saint Angelica,<br />
Whose love, stealing by steps into extremes,<br />
Grew by suspect to causeless lunacy.<br />
<br />
<i>Ang.</i> O no, my lord, but pardon my amiss;<br />
For had not Orlando lov'd Angelica,<br />
Ne'er had my lord fall'n into these extremes,<br />
Which we will parley private to ourselves.<br />
Ne'er was the Queen of Cyprus half so glad<br />
As is Angelica to see her lord,<br />
Her dear Orlando, settled in his sense.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Thanks, my sweet love.&mdash;<br />
But why stand the Prince of Africa,<br />
And Mandricard the King of Mexico,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>So deep in dumps, when all rejoice beside?<br />
First know, my lord, I slaughter'd Sacripant;<br />
I am the man that did the slave to death;<br />
Who frankly there did make confession,<br />
That he engrav'd the roundelays on the trees,<br />
And hung the schedules of poor Medor's love,<br />
Intending by suspect to breed debate<br />
Deeply 'twixt me and fair Angelica:<br />
His hope had hap, but we had all the harm;<br />
And now revenge, leaping from out the seat<br />
Of him that may command stern Nemesis,<br />
Hath pour'd those treasons justly on his head.<br />
What saith my gracious lord to this?<br />
<br />
<i>Mars.</i> I stand amaz'd, deep over-drench'd with joy,<br />
To hear and see this unexpected end:<br />
So well I rest content.&mdash;Ye peers of France,<br />
Sith it is prov'd Angelica is clear,<br />
Her and my crown I freely will bestow<br />
Upon Orlando, the County Palatine.<br />
<br />
<i>Orl.</i> Thanks my good lord.&mdash;And now, my friends of France,<br />
Frolic, be merry; we will hasten home,<br />
So soon as King Marsilius will consent<br />
To let his daughter wend with us to France.<br />
Meanwhile we'll richly rig up all our fleet<br />
More brave<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> than was that gallant Grecian keel<br />
That brought away the Colchian fleece of gold:<br />
Our sails of sendal<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> spread into the wind;<br />
Our ropes and tacklings all of finest silk,<br />
Fetch'd from the native looms of labouring worms,<br />
The pride of Barbary, and the glorious wealth<br />
That is transported by the western bounds;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Our stems cut out of gleaming ivory;<br />
Our planks and sides fram'd out of cypress-wood,<br />
That bears the name of Cyparissus' change,<br />
To burst the billows of the ocean-sea,<br />
Where Phœbus dips his amber tresses oft,<br />
And kisses Thetis in the day's decline;<br />
That Neptune proud shall call his Tritons forth<br />
To cover all the ocean with a calm:<br />
So rich shall be the rubbish of our barks,<br />
Ta'en here for ballass to the ports of France,<br />
That Charles himself shall wonder at the sight.<br />
Thus, lordings, when our banquetings be done,<br />
And Orlando espousèd to Angelica,<br />
We'll furrow through the moving ocean,<br />
And cheerly frolic with great Charlemagne.<br />

<h2><a name="FRIAR_BACON_AND" id="FRIAR_BACON_AND">FRIAR BACON AND
FRIAR BUNGAY</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>


<p>Of <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i> there are three quartos, dated
1594, 1630 and 1655. The first quarto was published by Edward
White, and 14th May 1594, the play is entered by the publisher on
the <i>Stationery Registers</i>. The two exemplars of this quarto are in the
British Museum and in Bridgewater House. In Henslowe's <i>Diary,
Friar Bacon</i> heads the list of plays by my Lord Strange's men in an
entry for 19th February 1592. At this time it was not a new play.
Between this date and 6th May it was performed by Strange's men
once every three weeks, and once a week between the following
10th January and 30th January. 1st April 1594, it was taken over
by the original owners, the Queen's players, who were then acting
with Sussex' players, and was performed 1st and 5th April at the
Rose Theatre. Presumably it was sent to press by the Queen's
men. At Christmas 1602 Middleton wrote a Prologue and
Epilogue for a performance of the play by the Admiral's men at
Court, for which he received five shillings. After this the play was
probably kept in the possession of the Admiral's players, for the
1630 title-page indicates its performance by the Palsgrave's men.
In no sense a plagiarism, the play is strictly a rival of Marlowe's
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>, and it must have been performed within a year
after Marlowe's play appeared in 1587. With <i>James IV.</i> it
represents Greene's dramatic workmanship at its best. A few
months after the appearance of the play it was parodied in <i>Fair
Em, The Miller's Daughter of Manchester</i>. Greene's play is based on
a romance written at the end of the sixteenth century, and probably
accessible to both Greene and Marlowe. The "wall of brass" is
common to both plays, and comes in each case directly from the
source-book, the <i>Famous History of Friar Bacon</i>. This popular
old story, of which the earliest extant edition is dated 1630, is now
accessible in Thoms' <i>Early English Prose Romances</i>, Vol. I. To
his source-material Greene added, probably out of his own head,
the character of Margaret and her touching love-story. For the
historical portions of the play there is no warrant in actual events.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>So frankly dealt, this hundred years before;<br />
Nor have I seen my lord more frolic in the chase,<br />
And now chang'd to a melancholy dump.<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> After the prince got to the keeper's lodge,<br />
And had been jocund in the house awhile,<br />
Tossing off ale and milk in country cans;<br />
Whether it was the country's sweet content,<br />
Or else the bonny damsel fill'd us drink,<br />
That seem'd so stately in her stammel<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> red,<br />
Or that a qualm did cross his stomach then,<br />
But straight he fell into his passions.<br />
<br />
<i>Erms.</i> Sirrah Ralph, what say you to your master,<br />
Shall he thus all amort<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> live malcontent?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Hearest thou, Ned?&mdash;Nay, look if he will
speak to me!</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> What say'st thou to me, fool?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> I prithee, tell me, Ned, art thou in love with
the Keeper's daughter?</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> How if I be, what then?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why then, sirrah, I'll teach thee how to deceive
love.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> How, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, Sirrah Ned, thou shalt put on my cap
and my coat and my dagger, and I will put on thy
clothes and thy sword; and so thou shalt be my fool.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> And what of this?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, so thou shalt beguile Love; for Love
is such a proud scab, that he will never meddle with
fools nor children. Is not Ralph's counsel good, Ned?</p>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> Tell me, Ned Lacy, didst thou mark the maid,<br />
How lovely in her country weeds she look'd?<br />
A bonnier wench all Suffolk cannot yield:&mdash;<br />
All Suffolk! nay, all England holds none such.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah Will Ermsby, Ned is deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Why, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> He says all England hath no such, and I say,
and I'll stand to it, there is one better in Warwickshire.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> How provest thou that, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, is not the abbot a learned man, and hath
read many books, and thinkest thou he hath not more
learning than thou to choose a bonny wench? yes, I
warrant thee, by his whole grammar.</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> A good reason, Ralph.</p>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> I tell thee, Lacy, that her sparkling eyes<br />
Do lighten forth sweet love's alluring fire;<br />
And in her tresses she doth fold the looks<br />
Of such as gaze upon her golden hair:<br />
Her bashful white, mix'd with the morning's red,<br />
Luna doth boast upon her lovely cheeks;<br />
Her front is beauty's table, where she paints<br />
The glories of her gorgeous excellence;<br />
Her teeth are shelves of precious margarites,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><br />
Richly enclos'd with ruddy coral cleeves.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a><br />
Tush, Lacy, she is beauty's over-match,<br />
If thou survey'st her curious imagery.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I grant, my lord, the damsel is as fair<br />
As simple Suffolk's homely towns can yield;<br />
But in the court be quainter<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> dames than she,<br />
Whose faces are enrich'd with honour's taint,<br />
Whose beauties stand upon the stage of fame,<br />
And vaunt their trophies in the courts of love.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Ah, Ned, but hadst thou watch'd her as myself,<br />
And seen the secret beauties of the maid,<br />
Their courtly coyness were but foolery.<br />
<br />
<i>Erms.</i> Why, how watch'd you her, my lord?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span><i>P. Edw.</i> Whenas she swept like Venus through the house,&mdash;<br />
And in her shape fast folded up my thoughts,&mdash;<br />
Into the milk-house went I with the maid,<br />
And there amongst the cream-bowls she did shine<br />
As Pallas 'mongst her princely huswifery:<br />
She turn'd her smock over her lily arms,<br />
And div'd them into milk to run her cheese;<br />
But whiter than the milk her crystal skin,<br />
Checkèd with lines of azure, made her blush,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a><br />
That art or nature durst bring for compare.<br />
Ermsby, if thou hadst seen, as I did note it well,<br />
How beauty play'd the huswife, how this girl,<br />
Like Lucrece, laid her fingers to the work,<br />
Thou wouldst, with Tarquin, hazard Rome and all<br />
To win the lovely maid of Fressingfield.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah Ned, wouldst fain have her?</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Ay, Ralph.</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> Why, Ned, I have laid the plot in my head;
thou shalt have her already.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> I'll give thee a new coat, an learn me that.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, Sirrah Ned, we'll ride to Oxford to
Friar Bacon: O, he is a brave scholar, sirrah; they
say he is a brave necromancer, that he can make women
of devils, and he can juggle cats into costermongers.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> And how then, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, Sirrah, thou shalt go to him: and because
thy father Harry shall not miss thee, he shall turn
me into thee; and I'll to the court, and I'll prince it out;
and he shall make thee either a silken purse full of gold,
or else a fine wrought smock.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> But how shall I have the maid?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, sirrah, if thou be'st a silken purse full
of gold, then on Sundays she'll hang thee by her side,
and you must not say a word. Now, sir, when she comes
into a great prease of people, for fear of the cutpurse, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a sudden she'll swap thee into her plackerd;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> then,
sirrah, being there, you may plead for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Excellent policy!</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> But how if I be a wrought smock?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Then she'll put thee into her chest and lay
thee into lavender, and upon some good day she'll put
thee on; and at night when you go to bed, then being
turned from a smock to a man, you may make up the
match.</p>

<p><i>Lacy.</i> Wonderfully wisely counselled, Ralph.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Ralph shall have a new coat.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> God thank you when I have it on my back,
Ned.</p>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> Lacy, the fool hath laid a perfect plot;<br />
For why our country Margaret is so coy,<br />
And stands so much upon her honest points,<br />
That marriage or no market with the maid.<br />
Ermsby, it must be necromantic spells<br />
And charms of art that must enchain her love,<br />
Or else shall Edward never win the girl.<br />
Therefore, my wags, we'll horse us in the morn,<br />
And post to Oxford to this jolly friar:<br />
Bacon shall by his magic do this deed.<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> Content, my lord; and that's a speedy way<br />
To wean these headstrong puppies from the teat.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I am unknown, not taken for the prince;<br />
They only deem us frolic courtiers,<br />
That revel thus among our liege's game:<br />
Therefore I have devis'd a policy.<br />
Lacy, thou know'st next Friday is Saint James',<br />
And then the country flocks to Harleston fair:<br />
Then will the Keeper's daughter frolic there,<br />
And over-shine the troop of all the maids<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>That come to see and to be seen that day.<br />
Haunt thee disguis'd among the country-swains,<br />
Feign thou'rt a farmer's son, not far from thence,<br />
Espy her loves, and who she liketh best;<br />
Cote<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> him, and court her to control the clown;<br />
Say that the courtier 'tirèd all in green,<br />
That help'd her handsomely to run her cheese,<br />
And fill'd her father's lodge with venison,<br />
Commends him, and sends fairings to herself.<br />
Buy something worthy of her parentage,<br />
Not worth her beauty; for, Lacy, then the fair<br />
Affords no jewel fitting for the maid:<br />
And when thou talk'st of me, note if she blush:<br />
O, then she loves; but if her cheeks wax pale,<br />
Disdain it is. Lacy, send how she fares,<br />
And spare no time nor cost to win her loves.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I will, my lord, so execute this charge,<br />
As if that Lacy were in love with her.<br />
</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Send letters speedily to Oxford of the news.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> And, Sirrah Lacy, buy me a thousand thousand
million of fine bells.</p>

<p><i>Lacy.</i> What wilt thou do with them, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, every time that Ned sighs for the
Keeper's daughter, I'll tie a bell about him: and so
within three or four days I will send word to his father
Harry, that his son, and my master Ned, is become
Love's morris-dance.</p>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> Well, Lacy, look with care unto thy charge,<br />
And I will haste to Oxford to the friar,<br />
That he by art, and thou by secret gifts<br />
Mayst make me lord of merry Fressingfield.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> God send your honour your heart's desire.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Friar Bacon's</span> <i>cell at Brazen-nose.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Friar Bacon</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>with books under his
arm; with them</i> <span class="smcap">Burden, Mason</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clement</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Miles, where are you?</p>

<p><i>Miles. Hic sum, doctissime et reverendissime doctor.</i></p>

<p><i>Bacon. Attulisti nos libros meos de necromantia?</i></p>

<p><i>Miles. Ecce quam bonum et quam jucundum habitare
libros in unum!</i></p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Now, masters of our academic state,<br />
That rule in Oxford, viceroys in your place,<br />
Whose heads contain maps of the liberal arts,<br />
Spending your time in depth of learnèd skill,<br />
Why flock you thus to Bacon's secret cell,<br />
A friar newly stall'd in Brazen-nose?<br />
Say what's your mind, that I may make reply.<br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> Bacon, we hear, that long we have suspect,<br />
That thou art read in magic's mystery;<br />
In pyromancy, to divine by flames;<br />
To tell, by hydromantic, ebbs and tides;<br />
By aeromancy to discover doubts,<br />
To plain out questions, as Apollo did.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Well, Master Burden, what of all this?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, sir, he doth but fulfil, by rehearsing of
these names, the fable of the Fox and the Grapes: that
which is above us pertains nothing to us.</p>

<p>
<i>Burd.</i> I tell thee, Bacon, Oxford makes report,<br />
Nay, England, and the court of Henry says<br />
Thou'rt making of a brazen head by art,<br />
Which shall unfold strange doubts and aphorisms,<br />
And read a lecture in philosophy;<br />
And, by the help of devils and ghastly fiends,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>Thou mean'st, ere many years or days be past,<br />
To compass England with a wall of brass.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> And what of this?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> What of this, master! why he doth speak mystically;
for he knows, if your skill fail to make a brazen
head, yet Mother Waters' strong ale will fit his turn to
make him have a copper nose.</p>

<p>
<i>Clem.</i> Bacon, we come not grieving at thy skill,<br />
But joying that our académy yields<br />
A man suppos'd the wonder of the world;<br />
For if thy cunning work these miracles,<br />
England and Europe shall admire thy fame,<br />
And Oxford shall in characters of brass,<br />
And statues, such as were built up in Rome,<br />
Etérnize Friar Bacon for his art.<br />
<br />
<i>Mason.</i> Then, gentle friar, tell us thy intent.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Seeing you come as friends unto the friar,<br />
Resolve<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> you, doctors, Bacon can by books<br />
Make storming Boreas thunder from his cave,<br />
And dim fair Luna to a dark eclipse.<br />
The great arch-ruler, potentate of hell,<br />
Trembles when Bacon bids him, or his fiends,<br />
Bow to the force of his pentageron.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><br />
What art can work, the frolic friar knows;<br />
And therefore will I turn my magic books,<br />
And strain out necromancy to the deep.<br />
I have contriv'd and fram'd a head of brass<br />
(I made Belcephon hammer out the stuff),<br />
And that by art shall read philosophy:<br />
And I will strengthen England by my skill,<br />
That if ten Cæsars liv'd and reign'd in Rome,<br />
With all the legions Europe doth contain,<br />
They should not touch a grass of English ground:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>The work that Ninus rear'd at Babylon,<br />
The brazen walls fram'd by Semiramis,<br />
Carv'd out like to the portal of the sun,<br />
Shall not be such as rings the English strand<br />
From Dover to the market-place of Rye.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> Is this possible?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> I'll bring ye two or three witnesses.</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> What be those?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, sir, three or four as honest devils and
good companions as any be in hell.</p>

<p>
<i>Mason.</i> No doubt but magic may do much in this;<br />
For he that reads but mathematic rules<br />
Shall find conclusions that avail to work<br />
Wonders that pass the common sense of men.<br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> But Bacon roves a bow beyond his reach,<br />
And tells of more than magic can perform;<br />
Thinking to get a fame by fooleries.<br />
Have I not pass'd as far in state of schools,<br />
And read of many secrets? yet to think<br />
That heads of brass can utter any voice,<br />
Or more, to tell of deep philosophy,<br />
This is a fable Æsop had forgot.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Burden, thou wrong'st me in detracting thus;<br />
Bacon loves not to stuff himself with lies:<br />
But tell me 'fore these doctors, if thou dare,<br />
Of certain questions I shall move to thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> I will: ask what thou can.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, sir, he'll straight be on your pick-pack,
to know whether the feminine or the masculine gender
be most worthy.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Were you not yesterday Master Burden, at
Henley upon the Thames?</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> I was: what then?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> What book studied you thereon all night?</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> I! none at all; I read not there a line.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Then, doctors, Friar Bacon's art knows naught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clem.</i> What say you to this, Master Burden? doth he
not touch you?</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> I pass not of<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> his frivolous speeches.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Nay, Master Burden, my master, ere he hath
done with you, will turn you from a doctor to a dunce,
and shake you so small, that he will leave no more
learning in you than is in Balaam's ass.</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Masters, for that learn'd Burden's skill is deep,<br />
And sore he doubts of Bacon's cabalism,<br />
I'll show you why he haunts to Henley oft:<br />
Not, doctors, for to taste the fragrant air,<br />
But there to spend the night in alchemy,<br />
To multiply with secret spells of art;<br />
Thus private steals he learning from us all.<br />
To prove my sayings true, I'll show you straight<br />
The book he keeps at Henley for himself.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Nay, now my master goes to conjuration, take
heed.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Masters, stand still, fear not, I'll show you but
his book.
[<i>Conjures.</i>
<i>Per omnes deos infernales, Belcephon!</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> Hostess <i>with a shoulder of mutton on a
spit, and a</i> Devil.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miles.</i> O, master, cease your conjuration, or you
spoil all; for here's a she-devil come with a shoulder of
mutton on a spit: you have marred the devil's supper;
but no doubt he thinks our college fare is slender, and
so hath sent you his cook with a shoulder of mutton, to
make it exceed.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> O, where am I, or what's become of me?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> What art thou?</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Hostess at Henley, mistress of the Bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> How camest thou here?</p>

<p>
<i>Hostess.</i> As I was in the kitchen 'mongst the maids,<br />
Spitting the meat against supper for my guess,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a><br />
A motion mov'd me to look forth of door:<br />
No sooner had I pried into the yard,<br />
But straight a whirlwind hoisted me from thence,<br />
And mounted me aloft unto the clouds.<br />
As in a trance I thought nor fearèd naught,<br />
Nor know I where or whither I was ta'en,<br />
Nor where I am, nor what these persons be.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> No? know you not Master Burden?<br />
<br />
<i>Hostess.</i> O, yes, good sir, he is my daily guest.&mdash;<br />
What, Master Burden! 'twas but yesternight<br />
That you and I at Henley play'd at cards.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> I know not what we did.&mdash;A pox of all conjuring
friars!</p>

<p><i>Clem.</i> Now, jolly friar, tell us, is this the book that
Burden is so careful to look on?</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> It is.&mdash;But, Burden, tell me now,<br />
Think'st thou that Bacon's necromantic skill<br />
Cannot perform his head and wall of brass,<br />
When he can fetch thine hostess in such post?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> I'll warrant you, master, if Master Burden could
conjure as well as you, he would have his book every
night from Henley to study on at Oxford.</p>

<p>
<i>Mason.</i> Burden, what, are you mated<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> by this frolic friar?&mdash;<br />
Look how he droops; his guilty conscience<br />
Drives him to 'bash and makes his hostess blush.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Well, mistress, for I will not have you miss'd,<br />
You shall to Henley to cheer up your guests<br />
'Fore supper gin.&mdash;Burden, bid her adieu;<br />
Say farewell to your hostess 'fore she goes.&mdash;<br />
Sirrah, away, and set her safe at home.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Master Burden, when shall we see you at
Henley?<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> Hostess <i>and</i> Devil.</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> The devil take thee and Henley too.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Master, shall I make a good motion?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, sir, now that my hostess is gone to
provide supper, conjure up another spirit, and send
Doctor Burden flying after.</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Thus, rulers of our academic state,<br />
You have seen the friar frame his art by proof;<br />
And as the college callèd Brazen-nose<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a><br />
Is under him, and he the master there,<br />
So surely shall this head of brass be fram'd,<br />
And yield forth strange and uncouth aphorisms;<br />
And hell and Hecate shall fail the friar,<br />
But I will circle England round with brass.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> So be it, <i>et nunc et semper</i>; amen.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Harleston Fair.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Joan; Thomas, Richard</span>, <i>and
other Clowns; and</i> <span class="smcap">Lacy</span> <i>disguised in country
apparel.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Thom.</i> By my troth, Margaret, here's a weather is able
to make a man call his father "whoreson": if this
weather hold, we shall have hay good cheap, and butter
and cheese at Harleston will bear no price.</p>

<p>
<i>Mar.</i> Thomas, maids when they come to see the fair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>Count not to make a cope<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> for dearth of hay:<br />
When we have turn'd our butter to the salt,<br />
And set our cheese safely upon the racks,<br />
Then let our fathers price it as they please.<br />
We country sluts of merry Fressingfield<br />
Come to buy needless naughts to make us fine,<br />
And look that young men should be frank this day,<br />
And court us with such fairings as they can.<br />
Phœbus is blithe, and frolic looks from heaven,<br />
As when he courted lovely Semele,<br />
Swearing the pedlers shall have empty packs,<br />
If that fair weather may make chapmen buy.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> But, lovely Peggy, Semele is dead,<br />
And therefore Phœbus from his palace pries,<br />
And, seeing such a sweet and seemly saint,<br />
Shows all his glories for to court yourself.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> This is a fairing, gentle sir, indeed,<br />
To soothe me up with such smooth flattery;<br />
But learn of me, your scoff's too broad before.&mdash;<br />
Well, Joan, our beauties must abide their jests;<br />
We serve the turn in jolly Fressingfield.<br />

I warrant you, the meanest of us both<br />
Shall have a mate to lead us from the church.<br />

But, Thomas, what's the news? what, in a dump?<br />
Give me your hand, we are near a pedler's shop;<br />
Out with your purse, we must have fairings now.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Thom.</i> Faith, Joan, and shall: I'll bestow a fairing on
you, and then we will to the tavern, and snap off a pint
of wine or two.</p>

<p>
<i>Mar.</i> Whence are you, sir? of Suffolk? for your terms<br />
Are finer than the common sort of men.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Faith, lovely girl, I am of Beccles by,<br />
Your neighbour, not above six miles from hence,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>A farmer's son, that never was so quaint<br />
But that he could do courtesy to such dames.<br />
But trust me, Margaret, I am sent in charge,<br />

And fill'd his lodge with cheer and venison,<br />
'Tirèd in green: he sent you this rich purse,<br />
His token that he help'd you run your cheese,<br />
And in the milkhouse chatted with yourself.<br />

<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Women are often weak in memory.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> O, pardon, sir, I call to mind the man:<br />
'Twere little manners to refuse his gift,<br />
And yet I hope he sends it not for love;<br />
For we have little leisure to debate of that.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Joan.</i> What, Margaret! blush not: maids must have
their loves.</p>

<p><i>Thom.</i> Nay, by the mass, she looks pale as if she were
angry.</p>

<p><i>Rich.</i> Sirrah, are you of Beccles? I pray, how doth
Goodman Cob? my father bought a horse of him.&mdash;I'll
tell you, Margaret, 'a were good to be a gentleman's jade,
for of all things the foul hilding could not abide a dung-cart.</p>

<p>
<i>Mar.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. How different is this farmer from the rest,<br />
That erst as yet have pleas'd my wandering sight!<br />
His words are witty, quicken'd with a smile,<br />
His courtesy gentle, smelling of the court;<br />
Facile and debonair in all his deeds;<br />
Proportion'd as was Paris, when, in grey,<br />
He courted Œnon in the vale by Troy.<br />
Great lords have come and pleaded for my love:<br />
Who but the Keeper's lass of Fressingfield?<br />
And yet methinks this farmer's jolly son<br />
Passeth the proudest that hath pleas'd mine eye.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>But, Peg, disclose not that thou art in love,<br />
And show as yet no sign of love to him,<br />
Although thou well wouldst wish him for thy love:<br />
Keep that to thee till time doth serve thy turn,<br />
To show the grief wherein thy heart doth burn.&mdash;<br />
Come, Joan and Thomas, shall we to the fair?&mdash;<br />
You, Beccles man, will not forsake us now?<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Not whilst I may have such quaint girls as you.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Well, if you chance to come by Fressingfield,<br />
Make but a step into the Keeper's lodge;<br />
And such poor fare as woodmen can afford,<br />
Butter and cheese, cream and fat venison,<br />
You shall have store, and welcome therewithal.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Gramercies, Peggy; look for me ere long.<br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND</h3>

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Court at Hampton House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">King Henry the Third</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Emperor of
Germany</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Castile, Elinor</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Vandermast</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. Hen.</i> Great men of Europe, monarchs of the West,<br />
Ring'd with the walls of old Oceanus,<br />
Whose lofty surge is like the battlements<br />
That compass'd high-built Babel in with towers,&mdash;<br />
Welcome, my lords, welcome, brave western kings,<br />
To England's shore, whose promontory-cleeves<br />
Show Albion is another little world;<br />
Welcome says English Henry to you all;<br />
Chiefly unto the lovely Elinor,<br />
Who dar'd for Edward's sake cut through the seas,<br />
And venture as Agenor's damsel through the deep,<br />
To get the love of Henry's wanton son.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cast.</i> England's rich monarch, brave Plantagenet,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>The Pyren Mounts swelling above the clouds,<br />
That ward the wealthy Castile in with walls,<br />
Could not detain the beauteous Elinor;<br />
But hearing of the fame of Edward's youth,<br />
She dar'd to brook Neptunus' haughty pride,<br />
And bide the brunt of froward Æolus:<br />
Then may fair England welcome her the more.<br />
<br />
<i>Elin.</i> After that English Henry by his lords<br />
Had sent Prince Edward's lovely counterfeit,<br />
A present to the Castile Elinor,<br />
The comely portrait of so brave a man,<br />
The virtuous fame discoursèd of his deeds,<br />
Edward's courageous resolution,<br />
Done at the Holy Land 'fore Damas'<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> walls,<br />
Led both mine eye and thoughts in equal links,<br />
To like so of the English monarch's son,<br />
That I attempted perils for his sake.<br />
<br />
<i>Emp.</i> Where is the prince, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> He posted down, not long since, from the court,<br />
To Suffolk side, to merry Framlingham,<br />
To sport himself amongst my fallow deer:<br />
From thence, by packets sent to Hampton House,<br />
We hear the prince is ridden, with his lords,<br />
To Oxford, in the académy there<br />
To hear dispute amongst the learnèd men.<br />
But we will send forth letters for my son,<br />
To will him come from Oxford to the court.<br />
<br />
<i>Emp.</i> Nay, rather, Henry, let us, as we be,<br />
Ride for to visit Oxford with our train.<br />
Fain would I see your universities,<br />
And what learn'd men your académy yields.<br />
From Hapsburg have I brought a learnèd clerk,<br />
To hold dispute with English orators:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>This doctor, surnam'd Jaques Vandermast,<br />
A German born, pass'd into Padua,<br />
To Florence and to fair Bologna,<br />
To Paris, Rheims, and stately Orleans,<br />
And, talking there with men of art, put down<br />
The chiefest of them all in aphorisms,<br />
In magic, and the mathematic rules:<br />
Now let us, Henry, try him in your schools.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> He shall, my lord; this motion likes me well.<br />
We'll progress straight to Oxford with our trains,<br />
And see what men our académy brings.&mdash;<br />
And, wonder Vandermast, welcome to me:<br />
In Oxford shalt thou find a jolly friar,<br />
Call'd Friar Bacon, England's only flower:<br />
Set him but non-plus in his magic spells,<br />
And make him yield in mathematic rules,<br />
And for thy glory I will bind thy brows,<br />
Not with a poet's garland made of bays,<br />
But with a coronet of choicest gold.<br />
Whilst then we set to Oxford with our troops,<br />
Let's in and banquet in our English court. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Street in Oxford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ralph Simnell</span> <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Edward's</span> <i>apparel;
and</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Edward, Warren</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ermsby</span>
<i>disguised.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Where be these vacabond knaves, that they
attend no better on their master?</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> If it please your honour, we are all ready at
an inch.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah Ned, I'll have no more post-horse to
ride on: I'll have another fetch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> I pray you, how is that, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, sir, I'll send to the Isle of Ely for four
or five dozen of geese, and I'll have them tied six and
six together with whip-cord: now upon their backs will
I have a fair field-bed with a canopy; and so, when it is
my pleasure, I'll flee into what place I please. This will
be easy.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Your honour hath said well: but shall we to
Brazen-nose College before we pull off our boots?</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Warren, well motioned; we will to the friar
before we revel it within the town.&mdash;Ralph, see you keep
your countenance like a prince.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Wherefore have I such a company of cutting<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
knaves to wait upon me, but to keep and defend my
countenance against all mine enemies? have you not
good swords and bucklers?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Friar Bacon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Stay, who comes here?</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Some scholar; and we'll ask him where Friar
Bacon is.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Why, thou arrant dunce, shall I never make
thee a good scholar? doth not all the town cry out and
say, Friar Bacon's subsizer is the greatest blockhead in
all Oxford? why, thou canst not speak one word of true
Latin.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> No, sir? yes! what is this else? <i>Ego sum tuus
homo</i>, "I am your man;" I warrant you, sir, as good
Tully's phrase as any is in Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Come on, sirrah; what part of speech is <i>Ego</i>?</p>

<p><i>Miles. Ego,</i> that is "I"; marry, <i>nomen substantivo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> How prove you that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Why, sir, let him prove himself an 'a will; I
can be heard, felt and understood.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> O gross dunce! [<i>Beats him.</i></p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Come, let us break off this dispute between
these two.&mdash;Sirrah, where is Brazen-nose College?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Not far from Coppersmith's Hall.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> What, dost thou mock me?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Not I, sir, but what would you at Brazen-nose?</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Marry, we would speak with Friar Bacon.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Whose men be you?</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Marry, scholar, here's our master.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah, I am the master of these good fellows;
mayst thou not know me to be a lord by my reparrel?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Then here's good game for the hawk; for
here's the master-fool, and a covey of coxcombs: one
wise man, I think, would spring you all.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Gog's wounds! Warren, kill him.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Why, Ned, I think the devil be in my sheath;
I cannot get out my dagger.</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Nor I mine: swones,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Ned, I think I am
bewitched.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> A company of scabs! the proudest of you all
draw your weapon, if he can.&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>]. See how boldly
I speak, now my master is by.</p>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> I strive in vain; but if my sword be shut<br />
And conjur'd fast by magic in my sheath,<br />
Villain, here is my fist.<br />
[<i>Strikes</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>a box on the ear.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> O, I beseech you conjure his hands too, that he
may not lift his arms to his head, for he is light-fingered!</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Ned, strike him; I'll warrant thee by mine
honour.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> What! means the English prince to wrong my
man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> To whom speakest thou?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> To thee.</p>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Who art thou?</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Could you not judge, when all your swords grew fast,<br />
That Friar Bacon was not far from hence?<br />
Edward, King Henry's son and Prince of Wales,<br />
Thy fool disguis'd cannot conceal thyself:<br />
I know both Ermsby and the Sussex Earl,<br />
Else Friar Bacon had but little skill.<br />
Thou com'st in post from merry Fressingfield,<br />
Fast-fancied<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> to the Keeper's bonny lass,<br />
To crave some succour of the jolly friar:<br />
And Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, hast thou left,<br />
To treat fair Margaret to allow thy loves;<br />
But friends are men, and love can baffle lords;<br />
The earl both woos and courts her for himself.<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> Ned, this is strange; the friar knoweth all.<br />
<br />
<i>Erms.</i> Apollo could not utter more than this.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I stand amaz'd to hear this jolly friar,<br />
Tell even the very secrets of my thoughts:&mdash;<br />
But, learnèd Bacon, since thou know'st the cause<br />
Why I did post so fast from Fressingfield,<br />
Help, friar, at a pinch, that I may have<br />
The love of lovely Margaret to myself,<br />
And, as I am true Prince of Wales, I'll give<br />
Living and lands to strength thy college state.<br />
</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Good friar, help the prince in this.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, servant Ned, will not the friar do it?&mdash;Were
not my sword glued to my scabbard by conjuration,
I would cut off his head, and make him do it by force.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> In faith, my lord, your manhood and your sword
is all alike; they are so fast conjured that we shall never
see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>Erms.</i> What, doctor, in a dump! tush, help the prince,<br />
And thou shalt see how liberal he will prove.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Crave not such actions greater dumps than these?<br />
I will, my lord, strain out my magic spells;<br />
For this day comes the earl to Fressingfield,<br />
And 'fore that night shuts in the day with dark,<br />
They'll be betrothèd each to other fast.<br />
But come with me; we'll to my study straight,<br />
And in a glass prospective<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> I will show<br />
What's done this day in merry Fressingfield.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Gramercies, Bacon; I will quite thy pain.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> But send your train, my lord, into the town:<br />
My scholar shall go bring them to their inn;<br />
Meanwhile we'll see the knavery of the earl.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Warren, leave me:&mdash;and, Ermsby, take the fool:<br />
Let him be master and go revel it,<br />
Till I and Friar Bacon talk awhile.<br />
</p>

<p><i>War.</i> We will, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Faith, Ned, and I'll lord it out till thou comest;
I'll be Prince of Wales over all the black-pots<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> in Oxford.

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Friar Bacon's</span> <i>Cell.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Friar Bacon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Edward</span> <i>go into the study.</i><a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Now, frolic Edward, welcome to my cell;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Here tempers Friar Bacon many toys,<br />
And holds this place his consistory-court,<br />
Wherein the devils plead homage to his words.<br />
Within this glass prospective thou shalt see<br />
This day what's done in merry Fressingfield<br />
'Twixt lovely Peggy and the Lincoln Earl.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Friar, thou glad'st me: now shall Edward try<br />
How Lacy meaneth to his sovereign lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Stand there and look directly in the glass.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Friar Bungay</span>.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
What sees my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I see the Keeper's lovely lass appear,<br />
As brightsome as the paramour of Mars,<br />
Only attended by a jolly friar.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Sit still, and keep the crystal in your eye.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> But tell me, Friar Bungay, is it true,<br />
That this fair, courteous, country swain,<br />
Who says his father is a farmer nigh,<br />
Can be Lord Lacy, Earl of Lincolnshire?<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Peggy, 'tis true, 'tis Lacy for my life,<br />
Or else mine art and cunning both do fail,<br />
Left by Prince Edward to procure his loves;<br />
For he in green, that holp you run your cheese,<br />
Is son to Henry, and the Prince of Wales.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Be what he will, his lure is but for lust:<br />
But did Lord Lacy like poor Margaret,<br />
Or would he deign to wed a country lass,<br />
Friar, I would his humble handmaid be,<br />
And for great wealth quite him with courtesy.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><i>Bun.</i> Why, Margaret, dost thou love him?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> His personage, like the pride of vaunting Troy,<br />
Might well avouch to shadow Helen's rape:<br />
His wit is quick and ready in conceit,<br />
As Greece afforded in her chiefest prime:<br />
Courteous, ah friar, full of pleasing smiles!<br />
Trust me, I love too much to tell thee more;<br />
Suffice to me he's England's paramour.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Hath not each eye that view'd thy pleasing face<br />
Surnamèd thee Fair Maid of Fressingfield?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Yes, Bungay, and would God the lovely earl<br />
Had that <i>in esse</i>, that so many sought.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Fear not, the friar will not be behind<br />
To show his cunning to entangle love.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I think the friar courts the bonny wench;<br />
Bacon, methinks he is a lusty churl.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Now look, my lord.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lacy</span> <i>disguised as before.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>P. Edw.</i> Gog's wounds, Bacon, here comes Lacy!</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Sit still, my lord, and mark the comedy.</p>

<p><i>Bun.</i> Here's Lacy, Margaret, step aside awhile.<br />
[<i>Retires with</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.</p>

<p>
<i>Lacy.</i> Daphne, the damsel that caught Phœbus fast,<br />
And lock'd him in the brightness of her looks,<br />
Was not so beauteous in Apollo's eyes<br />
As is fair Margaret to the Lincoln Earl.<br />
Recant thee, Lacy, thou art put in trust:&mdash;<br />
Edward, thy sovereign's son, hath chosen thee,<br />
A secret friend, to court her for himself,<br />
And dar'st thou wrong thy prince with treachery?&mdash;<br />
Lacy, love makes no exception of a friend,<br />
Nor deems it of a prince but as a man.<br />
Honour bids thee control him in his lust;<br />
His wooing is not for to wed the girl,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>But to entrap her and beguile the lass.<br />
Lacy, thou lov'st; then brook not such abuse,<br />
But wed her, and abide thy prince's frown:<br />
For better die, than see her live disgrac'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Come, friar, I will shake him from his dumps.&mdash;<br />
[<i>Comes forward.</i><br />
How cheer you, sir? a penny for your thought:<br />
You're early up, pray God it be the near.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a><br />
What, come from Beccles in a morn so soon?<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Thus watchful are such men as live in love,<br />
Whose eyes brook broken slumbers for their sleep.<br />
I tell thee, Peggy, since last Harleston fair<br />
My mind hath felt a heap of passions.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> A trusty man, that court it for your friend:<br />
Woo you still for the courtier all in green?&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside.</i>] I marvel that he sues not for himself.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Peggy, I pleaded first to get your grace for him;<br />
But when mine eyes survey'd your beauteous looks,<br />
Love, like a wag, straight div'd into my heart,<br />
And there did shrine the idea of yourself.<br />
Pity me, though I be a farmer's son,<br />
And measure not my riches, but my love.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> You are very hasty; for to garden well,<br />
Seeds must have time to sprout before they spring:<br />
Love ought to creep as doth the dial's shade,<br />
For timely ripe is rotten too-too soon.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> [<i>coming forward</i>]. <i>Deus hic</i>; room for a merry friar!<br />
What, youth of Beccles, with the Keeper's lass?<br />
'Tis well; but tell me, hear you any news.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> No, friar: what news?<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Hear you not how the pursuivants do post<br />
With proclamations through each country-town?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><i>Lacy.</i> For what, gentle friar? tell the news.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Dwell'st thou in Beccles, and hear'st not of these news?<br />
Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, is late fled<br />
From Windsor court, disguisèd like a swain,<br />
And lurks about the country here unknown.<br />
Henry suspects him of some treachery,<br />
And therefore doth proclaim in every way,<br />
That who can take the Lincoln Earl shall have,<br />
Paid in the Exchequer, twenty thousand crowns.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> The Earl of Lincoln! friar, thou art mad:<br />
It was some other; thou mistak'st the man:<br />
The Earl of Lincoln! why, it cannot be.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Yes, very well, my lord, for you are he:<br />
The Keeper's daughter took you prisoner:<br />
Lord Lacy, yield, I'll be your gaoler once.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> How familiar they be, Bacon!<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Sit still, and mark the sequel of their loves.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Then am I double prisoner to thyself:<br />
Peggy, I yield; but are these news in jest?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> In jest with you, but earnest unto me;<br />
For why these wrongs do wring me at the heart.<br />
Ah, how these earls and noblemen of birth<br />
Flatter and feign to forge poor women's ill.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Believe me, lass, I am the Lincoln Earl:<br />
I not deny but, 'tirèd thus in rags,<br />
I liv'd disguis'd to win fair Peggy's love.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> What love is there where wedding ends not love?<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I meant, fair girl, to make thee Lacy's wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> I little think that earls will stoop so low.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Say, shall I make thee countess ere I sleep?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Handmaid unto the earl, so please himself:<br />
A wife in name, but servant in obedience.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> The Lincoln Countess, for it shall be so:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>I'll plight the bands and seal it with a kiss.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Gog's wounds, Bacon, they kiss! I'll stab them.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> O, hold your hands, my lord, it is the glass.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Choler to see the traitors gree so well<br />
Made me think the shadows substances.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> 'Twere a long poniard, my lord, to reach between<br />
Oxford and Fressingfield; but sit still and see more.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Well, Lord of Lincoln, if your loves be knit,<br />
And that your tongues and thoughts do both agree,<br />
To avoid ensuing jars, I'll hamper up the match.<br />
I'll take my portace<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> forth, and wed you here:<br />
Then go to bed and seal up your desires.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Friar, content.&mdash;Peggy, how like you this?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> What likes my lord is pleasing unto me.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Then hand-fast hand, and I will to my book.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> What sees my lord now?<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Bacon, I see the lovers hand in hand,<br />
The friar ready with his portace there<br />
To wed them both: then am I quite undone.<br />
Bacon, help now, if e'er thy magic serv'd;<br />
Help, Bacon; stop the marriage now,<br />
If devils or necromancy may suffice,<br />
And I will give thee forty thousand crowns.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Fear not, my lord, I'll stop the jolly friar<br />
For mumbling up his orisons this day.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Why speak'st not, Bungay? Friar to thy book.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Bungay</span> <i>is mute, crying</i> "Hud, hud."<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> How look'st thou, friar, as a man distraught?<br />
Reft of thy senses, Bungay? show by signs<br />
If thou be dumb, what passion holdeth thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> He's dumb indeed. Bacon hath with his devils<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>Enchanted him, or else some strange disease<br />
Or apoplexy hath possess'd his lungs:<br />
But, Peggy, what he cannot with his book<br />
We'll 'twixt us both unite it up in heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Else let me die, my lord, a miscreant.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Why stands Friar Bungay so amaz'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> I have struck him dumb, my lord; and, if your honour please<br />
I'll fetch this Bungay straightway from Fressingfield,<br />
And he shall dine with us in Oxford here.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Bacon, do that, and thou contentest me.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Of courtesy, Margaret, let us lead the friar<br />
Unto thy father's lodge, to comfort him<br />
With broths, to bring him from this hapless trance.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Or else, my lord, we were passing unkind<br />
To leave the friar so in his distress.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Devil, <i>who carries off</i> <span class="smcap">Bungay</span> <i>on his back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
O, help, my lord! a devil, a devil, my lord!<br />
Look how he carries Bungay on his back!<br />
Let's hence, for Bacon's spirits be abroad.<br />
[<i>Exit with</i> <span class="smcap">Lacy</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Bacon, I laugh to see the jolly friar<br />
Mounted upon the devil, and how the earl<br />
Flees with his bonny lass for fear.<br />
As soon as Bungay is at Brazen-nose,<br />
And I have chatted with the merry friar,<br />
I will in post hie me to Fressingfield,<br />
And quite these wrongs on Lacy ere't be long.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> So be it, my lord: but let us to our dinner;<br />
For ere we have taken our repast awhile,<br />
We shall have Bungay brought to Brazen-nose.<br />

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>The Regent House at Oxford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Burden, Mason</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clement</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Mason.</i> Now that we are gathered in the Regent House,<br />
It fits us talk about the king's repair;<br />
For he, troop'd with all the western kings,<br />
That lie along'st the Dantzic seas by east,<br />
North by the clime of frosty Germany,<br />
The Almain monarch and the Saxon duke,<br />
Castile and lovely Elinor with him,<br />
Have in their jests resolv'd for Oxford town.<br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> We must lay plots of stately tragedies,<br />
Strange comic shows, such as proud Roscius<br />
Vaunted before the Roman Emperors,<br />
To welcome all the western potentates.<br />
<br />
<i>Clem.</i> But more; the king by letters hath foretold<br />
That Frederick, the Almain emperor,<br />
Hath brought with him a German of esteem,<br />
Whose surname is Don Jaques Vandermast,<br />
Skilful in magic and those secret arts.<br />
<br />
<i>Mason.</i> Then must we all make suit unto the friar,<br />
To Friar Bacon, that he vouch this task,<br />
And undertake to countervail in skill<br />
The German; else there's none in Oxford can<br />
Match and dispute with learnèd Vandermast.<br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> Bacon, if he will hold the German play,<br />
Will teach him what an English friar can do:<br />
The devil, I think, dare not dispute with him.<br />
<br />
<i>Clem.</i> Indeed, Mas doctor, he [dis]pleasur'd you,<br />
In that he brought your hostess, with her spit,<br />
From Henley, posting unto Brazen-nose.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><i>Burd.</i> A vengeance on the friar for his pains!<br />
But leaving that, let's hie to Bacon straight,<br />
To see if he will take this task in hand.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Clem.</i> Stay, what rumour is this? the town is up in a
mutiny: what hurly-burly is this?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Constable, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Ralph Simnell, Warren,
Ermsby</span>, <i>still disguised as before, and</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cons.</i> Nay, masters, if you were ne'er so good, you
shall before the doctors to answer your misdemeanour.</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> What's the matter, fellow?</p>

<p><i>Cons.</i> Marry, sir, here's a company of rufflers,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> that,
drinking in the tavern, have made a great brawl, and
almost killed the vintner.</p>

<p>
<i>Miles. Salve</i>, Doctor Burden!<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a><br />
This lubberly lurden,<br />
Ill-shap'd and ill-fac'd,<br />
Disdain'd and disgrac'd,<br />
What he tells unto <i>vobis</i><br />
<i>Mentitur de nobis.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Burd.</i> Who is the master and chief of this crew?<br />
<br />
<i>Miles. Ecce asinum mundi</i><br />
<i>Figura rotundi,</i><br />
Neat, sheat, and fine,<br />
As brisk as a cup of wine.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Burd.</i> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>]. What are you?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> I am, father doctor, as a man would say, the
bell-wether of this company: these are my lords, and I
the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p><i>Clem.</i> Are you Edward, the king's son?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah Miles, bring hither the tapster that
drew the wine, and, I warrant, when they see how
soundly I have broke his head, they'll say 'twas done
by no less man than a prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mason.</i> I cannot believe that this is the Prince of
Wales.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> And why so, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mason.</i> For they say the prince is a brave and a wise
gentleman.</p>

<p>
<i>War.</i> Why, and think'st thou, doctor, that he is not so?<br />
Dar'st thou detract and derogate from him,<br />
Being so lovely and so brave a youth?<br />
<br />
<i>Erms.</i> Whose face, shining with many a sugar'd smile,<br />
Bewrays that he is bred of princely race.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> And yet, master doctor,<br />
To speak like a proctor,<br />
And tell unto you<br />
What is veriment and true:<br />
To cease of this quarrel,<br />
Look but on his apparel;<br />
Then mark but my talis,<br />
He is great Prince of Walis,<br />
The chief of our <i>gregis,</i><br />
And <i>filius regis:</i><br />
Then 'ware what is done,<br />
For he is Henry's white<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> son.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Doctors, whose doting night-caps are not capable
of my ingenious dignity, know that I am Edward
Plantagenet, whom if you displease, will make a ship that
shall hold all your colleges, and so carry away the
university with a fair wind to the Bankside in Southwark.&mdash;How
sayest thou, Ned Warren, shall I not do it?</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Yes, my good lord; and, if it please your lordship,
I will gather up all your old pantofles,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and with
the cork make you a pinnace of five hundred ton, that
shall serve the turn marvellous well, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> And I, my lord, will have pioners to undermine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the town, that the very gardens and orchards be
carried away for your summer walks.</p>

<p>
<i>Miles.</i> And I, with <i>scientia</i><br />
And great <i>diligentia</i>,<br />
Will conjure and charm,<br />
To keep you from harm;<br />
That <i>utrum horum mavis</i>,<br />
Your very great <i>navis</i>,<br />
Like Barclay's ship,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a><br />
From Oxford do skip<br />
With colleges and schools,<br />
Full-loaden with fools.<br />
<i>Quid dicis ad hoc,</i><br />
Worshipful <i>Domine</i> Dawcock?<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Clem.</i> Why, hare-brain'd courtiers, are you drunk or mad,<br />
To taunt us up with such scurrility?<br />
Deem you us men of base and light esteem,<br />
To bring us such a fop for Henry's son?&mdash;<br />
Call out the beadles and convey them hence<br />
Straight to Bocardo:<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> let the roisters lie<br />
Close clapt in bolts, until their wits be tame.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> Why, shall we to prison, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> What sayest, Miles, shall I honour the prison
with my presence?</p>

<p>
<i>Miles.</i> No, no: out with your blades,<br />
And hamper these jades;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>Have a flurt and a crash,<br />
Now play revel-dash,<br />
And teach these sacerdos<br />
That the Bocardos,<br />
Like peasants and elves,<br />
Are meet for themselves.<br />
<br />
<i>Mason.</i> To the prison with them, constable.<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> Well, doctors, seeing I have sported me<br />
With laughing at these mad and merry wags,<br />
Know that Prince Edward is at Brazen-nose,<br />
And this, attirèd like the Prince of Wales,<br />
Is Ralph, King Henry's only lovèd fool;<br />
I, Earl of Sussex, and this Ermsby,<br />
One of the privy-chamber to the king;<br />
Who, while the prince with Friar Bacon stays,<br />
Have revell'd it in Oxford as you see.<br />
<br />
<i>Mason.</i> My lord, pardon us, we knew not what you were:<br />
But courtiers may make greater scapes than these.<br />
Wilt please your honour dine with me to-day?<br />
</p>

<p><i>War.</i> I will, Master doctor, and satisfy the vintner for
his hurt; only I must desire you to imagine him all this
forenoon the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p><i>Mason.</i> I will, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> And upon that I will lead the way; only I will
have Miles go before me, because I have heard Henry
say that wisdom must go before majesty. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<h3>ACT THE THIRD</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>At Fressingfield.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Edward</span> <i>with his poniard in his hand,</i>
<span class="smcap">Lacy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>P. Edw.</i> Lacy, thou canst not shroud thy traitorous thoughts,<br />
Nor cover, as did Cassius, all thy wiles;<br />
For Edward hath an eye that looks as far<br />
As Lyncæus from the shores of Græcia.<br />
Did I not sit in Oxford by the friar,<br />
And see thee court the maid of Fressingfield,<br />
Sealing thy flattering fancies with a kiss?<br />
Did not proud Bungay draw his portace forth,<br />
And joining hand in hand had married you,<br />
If Friar Bacon had not struck him dumb,<br />
And mounted him upon a spirit's back,<br />
That we might chat at Oxford with the friar?<br />
Traitor, what answer'st? is not all this true?<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Truth all, my lord; and thus I make reply,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>At Harleston fair, there courting for your grace,<br />
Whenas mine eye survey'd her curious shape,<br />
And drew the beauteous glory of her looks<br />
To dive into the centre of my heart,<br />
Love taught me that your honour did but jest,<br />
That princes were in fancy but as men;<br />
How that the lovely maid of Fressingfield<br />
Was fitter to be Lacy's wedded wife,<br />
Than concubine unto the Prince of Wales.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Injurious Lacy, did I love thee more<br />
Than Alexander his Hephæstion?<br />
Did I unfold the passions of my love,<br />
And lock them in the closet of thy thoughts?<br />
Wert thou to Edward second to himself,<br />
Sole friend and partner of his secret loves?<br />
And could a glance of fading beauty break<br />
Th' enchainèd fetters of such private friends?<br />
Base coward, false, and too effeminate<br />
To be corrival with a prince in thoughts!<br />
From Oxford have I posted since I din'd,<br />
To quite a traitor 'fore that Edward sleep.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> 'Twas I, my lord, not Lacy, stept awry:<br />
For oft he su'd and courted for yourself,<br />
And still woo'd for the courtier all in green;<br />
But I, whom fancy made but over-fond,<br />
Pleaded myself with looks as if I lov'd;<br />
I fed mine eye with gazing on his face,<br />
And still bewitch'd lov'd Lacy with my looks;<br />
My heart with sighs, mine eyes pleaded with tears,<br />
My face held pity and content at once;<br />
And more I could not cipher-out by signs<br />
But that I lov'd Lord Lacy with my heart.<br />
Then, worthy Edward, measure with thy mind<br />
If women's favours will not force men fall,<br />
If beauty, and if darts of piercing love,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Are not of force to bury thoughts of friends.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I tell thee, Peggy, I will have thy loves:<br />
Edward or none shall conquer Margaret.<br />
In frigates bottom'd with rich Sethin planks,<br />
Topt with the lofty firs of Lebanon,<br />
Stemm'd and encas'd with burnish'd ivory,<br />
And overlaid with plates of Persian wealth,<br />
Like Thetis shalt thou wanton on the waves,<br />
And draw the dolphins to thy lovely eyes,<br />
To dance lavoltas<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> in the purple streams:<br />
Sirens, with harps and silver psalteries,<br />
Shall wait with music at thy frigate's stem,<br />
And entertain fair Margaret with their lays.<br />
England and England's wealth shall wait on thee;<br />
Britain shall bend unto her prince's love,<br />
And do due homage to thine excellence,<br />
If thou wilt be but Edward's Margaret.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Pardon, my lord: if Jove's great royalty<br />
Sent me such presents as to Danaë;<br />
If Phœbus 'tirèd in Latona's webs,<br />
Came courting from the beauty of his lodge;<br />
The dulcet tunes of frolic Mercury,&mdash;<br />
Not all the wealth heaven's treasury affords,&mdash;<br />
Should make me leave Lord Lacy or his love.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I have learn'd at Oxford, there, this point of schools,&mdash;<br />
<i>Ablata causa, tollitur effectus:</i><br />
Lacy&mdash;the cause that Margaret cannot love<br />
Nor fix her liking on the English prince&mdash;<br />
Take him away, and then the effects will fail.<br />
Villain, prepare thyself; for I will bathe<br />
My poniard in the bosom of an earl.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Rather than live, and miss fair Margaret's love,<br />
Prince Edward, stop not at the fatal doom,<br />
But stab it home: end both my loves and life.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span><i>Mar.</i> Brave Prince of Wales, honour'd for royal deeds,<br />
'Twere sin to stain fair Venus' courts with blood;<br />
Love's conquest ends, my lord, in courtesy:<br />
Spare Lacy, gentle Edward; let me die,<br />
For so both you and he do cease your loves.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Lacy shall die as traitor to his lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I have deserv'd it, Edward; act it well.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> What hopes the prince to gain by Lacy's death?<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> To end the loves 'twixt him and Margaret.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Why, thinks King Henry's son that Margaret's love<br />
Hangs in th' uncertain balance of proud time?<br />
That death shall make a discord of our thoughts?<br />
No, stab the earl, and 'fore the morning sun<br />
Shall vaunt him thrice over the lofty east,<br />
Margaret will meet her Lacy in the heavens.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> If aught betides to lovely Margaret<br />
That wrongs or wrings her honour from content,<br />
Europe's rich wealth nor England's monarchy<br />
Should not allure Lacy to over-live:<br />
Then, Edward, short my life and end her loves.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Rid me, and keep a friend worth many loves.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Nay, Edward, keep a love worth many friends.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> An if thy mind be such as fame hath blaz'd,<br />
Then, princely Edward, let us both abide<br />
The fatal resolution of thy rage:<br />
Banish thou fancy, and embrace revenge,<br />
And in one tomb knit both our carcases,<br />
Whose hearts were linkèd in one perfect love.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] Edward, art thou that famous Prince of Wales,<br />
Who at Damasco beat the Saracens,<br />
And brought'st home triumph on thy lance's point?<br />
And shall thy plumes be pull'd by Venus down?<br />
Is't princely to dissever lover's leagues,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>To part such friends as glory in their loves?<br />
Leave, Ned, and make a virtue of this fault,<br />
And further Peg and Lacy in their loves:<br />
So in subduing fancy's passion,<br />
Conquering thyself, thou gett'st the richest spoil.&mdash;<br />
Lacy, rise up. Fair Peggy, here's my hand:<br />
The Prince of Wales hath conquer'd all his thoughts,<br />
And all his loves he yields unto the earl.<br />
Lacy, enjoy the maid of Fressingfield;<br />
Make her thy Lincoln Countess at the church,<br />
And Ned, as he is true Plantagenet,<br />
Will give her to thee frankly for thy wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Humbly I take her of my sovereign,<br />
As if that Edward gave me England's right,<br />
And rich'd me with the Albion diadem.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> And doth the English prince mean true?<br />
Will he vouchsafe to cease his former loves,<br />
And yield the title of a country maid<br />
Unto Lord Lacy?<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> I will, fair Peggy, as I am true lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Then, lordly sir, whose conquest is as great,<br />
In conquering love, as Cæsar's victories,<br />
Margaret, as mild and humble in her thoughts<br />
As was Aspasia unto Cyrus self,<br />
Yields thanks, and, next Lord Lacy, doth enshrine<br />
Edward the second secret in her heart.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Gramercy, Peggy:&mdash;now that vows are past,<br />
And that your loves are not to be revolt,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a><br />
Once, Lacy, friends again. Come, we will post<br />
To Oxford; for this day the king is there,<br />
And brings for Edward Castile Elinor.<br />
Peggy, I must go see and view my wife:<br />
I pray God I like her as I lovèd thee.<br />
Beside, Lord Lincoln, we shall hear dispute<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>'Twixt Friar Bacon and learn'd Vandermast.<br />
Peggy, we'll leave you for a week or two.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> As it please Lord Lacy: but love's foolish looks<br />
Think footsteps miles, and minutes to be hours.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I'll hasten, Peggy, to make short return.&mdash;<br />
But please your honour go unto the lodge,<br />
We shall have butter, cheese, and venison;<br />
And yesterday I brought for Margaret<br />
A lusty bottle of neat claret-wine:<br />
Thus can we feast and entertain your grace.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> 'Tis cheer, Lord Lacy, for an Emperor,<br />
If he respect the person and the place:<br />
Come, let us in; for I will all this night<br />
Ride post until I come to Bacon's cell.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>At Oxford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">King Henry</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">King of
Castile, Elinor, Vandermast</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bungay</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Emp.</i> Trust me, Plantagenet, these Oxford schools<br />
Are richly seated near the river-side:<br />
The mountains full of fat and fallow deer,<br />
The battling<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> pastures lade<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> with kine and flocks,<br />
The town gorgeous with high-built colleges,<br />
And scholars seemly in their grave attire,<br />
Learnèd in searching principles of art.&mdash;<br />
What is thy judgment, Jaques Vandermast?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> That lordly are the buildings of the town,<br />
Spacious the rooms, and full of pleasant walks;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>But for the doctors, how that they be learnèd,<br />
It may be meanly, for aught I can hear.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> I tell thee, German, Hapsburg holds none such<br />
None read so deep as Oxenford contains:<br />
There are within our academic state<br />
Men that may lecture it in Germany<br />
To all the doctors of your Belgic schools.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> Stand to him, Bungay, charm this Vandermast,<br />
And I will use thee as a royal king.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Wherein dar'st thou dispute with me?<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> In what a doctor and a friar can.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Before rich Europe's worthies put thou forth<br />
The doubtful question unto Vandermast.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bun.</i> Let it be this,&mdash;Whether the spirits of pyromancy
or geomancy, be most predominant in magic?</p>

<p><i>Van.</i> I say, of pyromancy.</p>

<p><i>Bun.</i> And I, of geomancy.</p>

<p>
<i>Van.</i> The cabalists that write of magic spells,<br />
As Hermes,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Melchie,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and Pythagoras,<br />
Affirm that, 'mongst the quadruplicity<br />
Of elemental essence, <i>terra</i> is but thought<br />
To be a <i>punctum</i> squarèd to<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> the rest;<br />
And that the compass of ascending elements<br />
Exceed in bigness as they do in height;<br />
Judging the concave circle of the sun<br />
To hold the rest in his circumference.<br />
If, then, as Hermes says, the fire be greatest,<br />
Purest, and only giveth shape to spirits,<br />
Then must these dæmones that haunt that place<br />
Be every way superior to the rest.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> I reason not of elemental shapes,<br />
Nor tell I of the concave latitudes,<br />
Noting their essence nor their quality,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>But of the spirits that pyromancy calls,<br />
And of the vigour of the geomantic fiends.<br />
I tell thee, German, magic haunts the ground,<br />
And those strange necromantic spells<br />
That work such shows and wondering in the world<br />
Are acted by those geomantic spirits<br />
That Hermes calleth <i>terræ filii</i>.<br />
The fiery spirits are but transparent shades,<br />
That lightly pass as heralds to bear news;<br />
But earthly fiends, clos'd in the lowest deep,<br />
Dissever mountains, if they be but charg'd,<br />
Being more gross and massy in their power.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Rather these earthly geomantic spirits<br />
Are dull and like the place where they remain;<br />
For when proud Lucifer fell from the heavens,<br />
The spirits and angels that did sin with him,<br />
Retain'd their local essence as their faults,<br />
All subject under Luna's continent:<br />
They which offended less hung in the fire,<br />
And second faults did rest within the air;<br />
But Lucifer and his proud-hearted fiends<br />
Were thrown into the centre of the earth,<br />
Having less understanding than the rest,<br />
As having greater sin and lesser grace.<br />
Therefore such gross and earthly spirits do serve<br />
For jugglers, witches, and vile sorcerers;<br />
Whereas the pyromantic genii<br />
Are mighty, swift, and of far-reaching power.<br />
But grant that geomancy hath most force;<br />
Bungay, to please these mighty potentates,<br />
Prove by some instance what thy art can do.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> I will.<br />
<br />
<i>Emp.</i> Now, English Harry, here begins the game;<br />
We shall see sport between these learnèd men.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> What wilt thou do?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span><i>Bun.</i> Show thee the tree, leav'd with refinèd gold,<br />
Whereon the fearful dragon held his seat,<br />
That watch'd the garden call'd Hesperides,<br />
Subdu'd and won by conquering Hercules.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Bungay</span> <i>conjures, and the Tree appears with the
Dragon shooting fire.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Van.</i> Well done!<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> What say you, royal lordings, to my friar?<br />
Hath he not done a point of cunning skill?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Each scholar in the necromantic spells<br />
Can do as much as Bungay hath perform'd.<br />
But as Alcmena's bastard raz'd this tree,<br />
So will I raise him up as when he liv'd,<br />
And cause him pull the dragon from his seat,<br />
And tear the branches piecemeal from the root.&mdash;<br />
Hercules! <i>Prodi, prodi,</i> Hercules!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Hercules</span> <i>appears in his lion's skin.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Her. Quis me vult?</i><br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Jove's bastard son, thou Libyan Hercules,<br />
Pull off the sprigs from off the Hesperian tree,<br />
As once thou didst to win the golden fruit.<br />
<br />
<i>Her. Fiat.</i> [<i>Begins to break the branches.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Now, Bungay, if thou canst by magic charm<br />
The fiend, appearing like great Hercules,<br />
From pulling down the branches of the tree,<br />
Then art thou worthy to be counted learnèd.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> I cannot.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Cease, Hercules, until I give thee charge.&mdash;<br />
Mighty commander of this English isle,<br />
Henry, come from the stout Plantagenets,<br />
Bungay is learn'd enough to be a friar;<br />
But to compare with Jaques Vandermast,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Oxford and Cambridge must go seek their cells<br />
To find a man to match him in his art.<br />

Frankfort, Lutrech,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and Orleans:<br />

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> All hail to this royal company,<br />
That sit to hear and see this strange dispute!&mdash;<br />
Bungay, how stand'st thou as a man amaz'd?<br />
What, hath the German acted more than thou?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> What art thou that question'st thus?<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Men call me Bacon.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Lordly thou look'st, as if that thou wert learn'd;<br />
Thy countenance, as if science held her seat<br />
Between the circled arches of thy brows.<br />
<br />

<br />

Lest thou dost lose what foretime thou didst gain.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Bacon, wilt thou dispute?<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> No, unless he were more learn'd than Vandermast;<br />
For yet, tell me, what hast thou done?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Rais'd Hercules to ruinate that tree,<br />
That Bungay mounted by his magic spells.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Set Hercules to work.<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Now, Hercules, I charge thee to thy task;<br />
Pull off the golden branches from the root.<br />
<br />
<i>Her.</i> I dare not; see'st thou not great Bacon here,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Whose frown doth act more than thy magic can?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> By all the thrones, and dominations,<br />
Virtues, powers, and mighty hierarchies,<br />
I charge thee to obey to Vandermast.<br />
<br />
<i>Her.</i> Bacon, that bridles headstrong Belcephon,<br />
And rules Asmenoth, guider of the north,<br />
Binds me from yielding unto Vandermast.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> How now, Vandermast! have you met with your match?<br />
<br />
<i>Van.</i> Never before was't known to Vandermast<br />
That men held devils in such obedient awe.<br />
Bacon doth more than art, or else I fail.<br />
<br />
<i>Emp.</i> Why, Vandermast, art thou overcome?&mdash;<br />
Bacon, dispute with him, and try his skill.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> I came not, monarchs, for to hold dispute<br />
With such a novice as is Vandermast;<br />
I came to have your royalties to dine<br />
With Friar Bacon here in Brazen-nose:<br />
And, for this German troubles but the place,<br />
And holds this audience with a long suspence,<br />
I'll send him to his académy hence.&mdash;<br />
Thou, Hercules, whom Vandermast did raise,<br />
Transport the German unto Hapsburg straight,<br />
That he may learn by travail, 'gainst the spring,<br />
More secret dooms and aphorisms of art.<br />
Vanish the tree, and thou away with him!<br />

<i>Bacon.</i> To Hapsburg: there your highness at return<br />
Shall find the German in his study safe.<br />

And made fair Oxford famous by thine art:<br />
I will be English Henry to thyself;&mdash;<br />

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>At Fressingfield.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Serlsby</span> <i>with the</i> Keeper.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lam.</i> Come, frolic Keeper of our liege's game,<br />
Whose table spread hath other venison<br />
And jacks of wines to welcome passengers,<br />
Know I'm in love with jolly Margaret,<br />
That overshines our damsels as the moon<br />
Darkeneth the brightest sparkles of the night.<br />
In Laxfield here my land and living lies:<br />
I'll make thy daughter jointer of it all,<br />
So thou consent to give her to my wife;<br />
And I can spend five-hundred marks a year.<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> I am the lands-lord, Keeper, of thy holds,<br />
By copy all thy living lies in me;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>Laxfield did never see me raise my due:<br />
I will enfeoff fair Margaret in all,<br />
So she will take her to a lusty squire.<br />
<br />
<i>Keep.</i> Now, courteous gentles, if the Keeper's girl<br />
Hath pleas'd the liking fancy of you both,<br />
And with her beauty hath subdu'd your thoughts,<br />
'Tis doubtful to decide the question.<br />
It joys me that such men of great esteem<br />
Should lay their liking on this base estate,<br />
And that her state should grow so fortunate<br />
To be a wife to meaner men than you:<br />
But sith such squires will stoop to keeper's fee,<br />
I will, to avoid displeasure of you both,<br />
Call Margaret forth, and she shall make her choice.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Content, Keeper; send her unto us.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> Keeper.<br />
Why, Serlsby, is thy wife so lately dead,<br />
Are all thy loves so lightly passèd over,<br />
As thou canst wed before the year be out?<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> I live not, Lambert, to content the dead,<br />
Nor was I wedded but for life to her:<br />
The grave ends and begins a married state.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lam.</i> Peggy, the lovely flower of all towns,<br />
Suffolk's fair Helen, and rich England's star,<br />
Whose beauty, temper'd with her huswifery,<br />
Makes England talk of merry Fressingfield!<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> I cannot trick it up with poesies,<br />
Nor paint my passions with comparisons,<br />
Nor tell a tale of Phœbus and his loves:<br />
But this believe me,&mdash;Laxfield here is mine,<br />
Of ancient rent seven-hundred pounds a year;<br />
And if thou canst but love a country squire,<br />
I will enfeoff thee, Margaret, in all:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>I cannot flatter; try me, if thou please.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Brave neighbouring squires, the stay of Suffolk's clime,<br />
A keeper's daughter is too base in gree<br />
To match with men accounted of such worth:<br />
But might I not displease, I would reply.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Say, Peggy; naught shall make us discontent.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Then, gentles, note that love hath little stay,<br />
Nor can the flames that Venus sets on fire<br />
Be kindled but by fancy's motion:<br />
Then pardon, gentles, if a maid's reply<br />
Be doubtful, while I have debated with myself,<br />
Who, or of whom, love shall constrain me like.<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> Let it be me; and trust me, Margaret,<br />
The meads environ'd with the silver streams,<br />
Whose battling pastures fatten all my flocks,<br />
Yielding forth fleeces stapled with such wool,<br />
As Lemnster cannot yield more finer stuff,<br />
And forty kine with fair and burnish'd heads,<br />
With strouting<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> dugs that paggle to the ground,<br />
Shall serve thy dairy, if thou wed with me.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Let pass the country wealth, as flocks and kine,<br />
And lands that wave with Ceres' golden sheaves,<br />
Filling my barns with plenty of the fields;<br />
But, Peggy, if thou wed thyself to me,<br />
Thou shalt have garments of embroider'd silk,<br />
Lawns, and rich net-works for thy head-attire:<br />
Costly shall be thy fair habiliments,<br />
If thou wilt be but Lambert's loving wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Content you, gentles, you have proffer'd fair,<br />
And more than fits a country maid's degree:<br />
But give me leave to counsel me a time,<br />
For fancy blooms not at the first assault;<br />
Give me but ten days' respite, and I will reply,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Which or to whom myself affectionates.<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> Lambert, I tell thee thou'rt importunate;<br />
Such beauty fits not such a base esquire:<br />
It is for Serlsby to have Margaret.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Think'st thou with wealth to overreach me?<br />
Serlsby, I scorn to brook thy country braves:<br />
I dare thee, coward, to maintain this wrong,<br />
At dint of rapier, single in the field.<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> I'll answer, Lambert, what I have avouch'd.&mdash;<br />
Margaret, farewell; another time shall serve.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> I'll follow&mdash;Peggy, farewell to thyself;<br />
Listen how well I'll answer for thy love.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> How fortune tempers lucky haps with frowns,<br />
And wrongs me with the sweets of my delight!<br />
Love is my bliss, and love is now my bale.<br />
Shall I be Helen in my froward fates,<br />
As I am Helen in my matchless hue,<br />
And set rich Suffolk with my face afire?<br />
If lovely Lacy were but with his Peggy,<br />
The cloudy darkness of his bitter frown<br />
Would check the pride of these aspiring squires.<br />
Before the term of ten days be expir'd,<br />
Whenas they look for answer of their loves,<br />
My lord will come to merry Fressingfield,<br />
And end their fancies and their follies both:<br />
Till when, Peggy, be blithe and of good cheer.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Post <i>with a letter and a bag of gold.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Post.</i> Fair, lovely damsel, which way leads this path?<br />
How might I post me unto Fressingfield?<br />
Which footpath leadeth to the Keeper's lodge?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Your way is ready, and this path is right:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Myself do dwell hereby in Fressingfield;<br />
And if the Keeper be the man you seek,<br />
I am his daughter: may I know the cause?<br />
<br />
<i>Post.</i> Lovely, and once belovèd of my lord,&mdash;<br />
No marvel if his eye was lodg'd so low,<br />
When brighter beauty is not in the heavens,&mdash;<br />
The Lincoln Earl hath sent you letters here,<br />
And, with them, just an hundred pounds in gold.<br />
Sweet, bonny wench, read them, and make reply.<br />
[<i>Gives letter and bag.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> The scrolls that Jove sent Danaë,<br />
Wrapt in rich closures of fine burnish'd gold,<br />
Were not more welcome than these lines to me.<br />
Tell me, whilst that I do unrip the seals,<br />
Lives Lacy well? how fares my lovely lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Post.</i> Well, if that wealth may make men to live well.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>reads.</i>] <i>The blooms of the almond tree grow in a
night, and vanish in a morn; the flies hæmeræ, fair
Peggy, take life with the sun, and die with the dew; fancy
that slippeth in with a gaze, goeth out with a wink; and
too timely loves have ever the shortest length. I write this
as thy grief and my folly, who at Fressingfield loved that
which time hath taught me to be but mean dainties: eyes
are dissemblers, and fancy is but queasy; therefore know,
Margaret, I have chosen a Spanish lady to be my wife,
chief waiting-woman to the Princess Elinor; a lady fair,
and no less fair than thyself, honourable and wealthy. In
that I forsake thee, I leave thee to thine own liking; and
for thy dowry I have sent thee an hundred pounds; and
ever assure thee of my favour, which shall avail thee and
thine much. Farewell.</i></p>

As lighten'd mischief from their infancy?<br />
If heavens had vow'd, if stars had made decree,<br />
To show on me their froward influence,<br />
If Lacy had but lov'd, heavens, hell, and all<br />
Could not have wrong'd the patience of my mind.<br />
<br />
<i>Post.</i> It grieves me, damsel; but the earl is forc'd<br />
To love the lady by the king's command.<br />

Europe's commander, nor the English king,<br />
Should not have mov'd the love of Peggy from her lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Post.</i> What answer shall I return to my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> First, for thou cam'st from Lacy whom I lov'd,&mdash;<br />
Ah, give me leave to sigh at every thought!&mdash;<br />
Take thou, my friend, the hundred pound he sent;<br />
For Margaret's resolution craves no dower:<br />
The world shall be to her as vanity;<br />
Wealth, trash; love, hate; pleasure, despair:<br />
For I will straight to stately Framlingham,<br />
And in the abbey there be shorn a nun,<br />
And yield my loves and liberty to God.<br />
Fellow, I give thee this, not for the news,<br />
For those be hateful unto Margaret,<br />
But for thou'rt Lacy's man, once Margaret's love.<br />
<br />
<i>Post.</i> What I have heard, what passions I have seen,<br />
I'll make report of them unto the earl.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Say that she joys his fancies be at rest.<br />
And prays that his misfortune may be hers.<br />

The rafters of the earth rent from the poles,<br />
And three-form'd Luna hid her silver looks,<br />
Trembling upon her concave continent,<br />
When Bacon read upon his magic book.<br />
With seven years' tossing necromantic charms,<br />
Poring upon dark Hecat's principles,<br />
I have fram'd out a monstrous head of brass,<br />
That, by the enchanting forces of the devil,<br />
Shall tell out strange and uncouth aphorisms,<br />
And girt fair England with a wall of brass.<br />
Bungay and I have watch'd these threescore days,<br />
And now our vital spirits crave some rest:<br />
If Argus liv'd, and had his hundred eyes,<br />
They could not over watch Phobetor's night.<br />
Now, Miles, in thee rests Friar Bacon's weal:<br />
The honour and renown of all his life<br />
Hangs in the watching of this Brazen Head;<br />
Therefore I charge thee by the immortal God,<br />
That holds the souls of men within his fist,<br />
This night thou watch; for ere the morning-star<br />
Sends out his glorious glister on the north,<br />
The head will speak: then, Miles, upon thy life,<br />
Wake me; for then by magic art I'll work<br />
To end my seven years' task with excellence.<br />
If that a wink but shut thy watchful eye,<br />
Then farewell Bacon's glory and his fame!<br />
Draw close the curtains, Miles: now, for thy life,<br />
Be watchful, and&mdash;[<i>Falls asleep.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> So; I thought you would talk yourself asleep
anon; and 'tis no marvel, for Bungay on the days, and
he on the nights, have watch'd just these ten and fifty
days: now this is the night, and 'tis my task, and no
more. Now, Jesus bless me, what a goodly head it is!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and a nose! you talk of <i>nos autem glorificare</i>;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> but
here's a nose that I warrant may be called <i>nos autem
populare</i> for the people of the parish. Well, I am
furnished with weapons: now, sir, I will set me down
by a post, and make it as good as a watchman to wake
me, if I chance to slumber. I thought, Goodman Head,
I would call you out of your <i>memento</i> ... Passion o'
God, I have almost broke my pate! [<i>A great noise.</i>]
Up, Miles, to your task; take your brown-bill<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> in your
hand; here's some of your master's hobgoblins abroad.</p>

<p><i>The Brazen Head.</i> Time is.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Time is! Why, Master Brazen-head, have you
such a capital nose, and answer you with syllables,
"Time is"? Is this all my master's cunning, to spend
seven years' study about "Time is"? Well, sir, it may
be we shall have some better orations of it anon: well,
I'll watch you as narrowly as ever you were watched,
and I'll play with you as the nightingale with the slow-worm;
I'll set a prick against my breast. Now rest
there, Miles.&mdash;Lord have mercy upon me, I have almost
killed myself! [<i>A great noise.</i>] Up, Miles; list how
they rumble.</p>

<p><i>The Brazen Head.</i> Time was.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Well, Friar Bacon, you have spent your seven
years' study well, that can make your head speak but two
words at once, "Time was." Yea, marry, time was when
my master was a wise man, but that was before he began
to make the Brazen Head. You shall lie while your arse
ache, an your Head speak no better. Well, I will watch,
and walk up and down, and be a peripatetian and a
philosopher of Aristotle's stamp. [<i>A great noise.</i>]
What, a fresh noise? Take thy pistols in hand,
Miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Brazen Head.</i> Time is past.<br />
[<i>A lightning flashes forth, and a hand appears that
breaks down the</i> Head <i>with a hammer.</i></p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Master, master, up! hell's broken loose; your
Head speaks; and there's such a thunder and lightning,
that I warrant all Oxford is up in arms. Out of your
bed, and take a brown-bill in your hand; the latter day
is come.</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Miles, I come. O passing warily watch'd!<br />
Bacon will make thee next himself in love.<br />
When spake the head?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> When spake the head! did not you say that he
should tell strange principles of philosophy? Why, sir,
it speaks but two words at a time.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Why, villain, hath it spoken oft?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Oft! ay, marry, hath it, thrice: but in all
those three times it hath uttered but seven words.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, sir, the first time he said, "Time is," as
if Fabius Cumentator<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> should have pronounced a
sentence; [the second time] he said "Time was"; and
the third time with thunder and lightning, as in great
choler, he said, "Time is past."</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> 'Tis past indeed. Ah, villain! time is past:<br />
My life, my fame, my glory, all are past.&mdash;<br />
Bacon, the turrets of thy hope are ruin'd down,<br />
Thy seven years' study lieth in the dust:<br />
Thy Brazen Head lies broken through a slave,<br />
That watch'd, and would not when the Head did will.&mdash;<br />
What said the Head first?<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Even, sir, "Time is."<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Villain, if thou hadst call'd to Bacon then,<br />
If thou hadst watch'd, and wak'd the sleepy friar,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>The Brazen Head had utter'd aphorisms,<br />
And England had been circled round with brass:<br />
But proud Asmenoth, ruler of the north,<br />
And Demogorgon, master of the fates,<br />
Grudge that a mortal man should work so much.<br />
Hell trembled at my deep-commanding spells,<br />
Fiends frown'd to see a man their over-match;<br />
Bacon might boast more than a man might boast:<br />
But now the braves of Bacon have an end,<br />
Europe's conceit of Bacon hath an end,<br />
His seven years' practice sorteth to ill end:<br />
And, villain, sith my glory hath an end,<br />
I will appoint thee to some fatal end.<br />
Villain, avoid! get thee from Bacon's sight!<br />
Vagrant, go roam and range about the world,<br />
And perish as a vagabond on earth.<br />
<br />
<i>Miles.</i> Why, then, sir, you forbid me your service?<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> My service, villain! with a fatal curse,<br />
That direful plagues and mischief fall on thee.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> 'Tis no matter, I am against you with the old
proverb&mdash;"The more the fox is curst<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the better he fares."
God be with you, sir; I'll take but a book in my hand,
a wide-sleeved gown on my back, and a crowned cap on
my head, and see if I can want promotion. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> Some fiend or ghost haunt on thy weary steps,<br />
Until they do transport thee quick to hell:<br />
For Bacon shall have never merry day,<br />
To lose the fame and honour of his Head. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>At Court.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Castile, King
Henry, Elinor, Prince Edward, Lacy</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Ralph Simnell</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Emp.</i> Now, lovely prince, the prime of Albion's wealth,<br />
How fare the Lady Elinor and you?<br />
What, have you courted and found Castile fit<br />
To answer England in equivalence?<br />
Will 't be a match 'twixt bonny Nell and thee?<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Should Paris enter in the courts of Greece,<br />
And not lie fetter'd in fair Helen's looks?<br />
Or Phœbus scape those piercing amorets,<br />
That Daphne glancèd at his deity?<br />
Can Edward, then, sit by a flame and freeze,<br />
Whose heat puts Helen and fair Daphne down?<br />
Now, monarchs, ask the lady if we gree.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> What, madam, hath my son found grace or no?<br />
<br />
<i>Elin.</i> Seeing, my lord, his lovely counterfeit,<br />
And hearing how his mind and shape agreed,<br />
I came not, troop'd with all this warlike train,<br />
Doubting of love, but so affectionate,<br />
As Edward hath in England what he won in Spain.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cast.</i> A match, my lord; these wantons needs must love:<br />
Men must have wives, and women will be wed:<br />
Let's haste the day to honour up the rites.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Sirrah Harry, shall Ned marry Nell?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Ay, Ralph; how then?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Marry, Harry, follow my counsel: send for
Friar Bacon to marry them, for he'll so conjure him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
her with his necromancy, that they shall love together
like pig and lamb whilst they live.</p>

<p><i>K. of Cast.</i> But hearest thou, Ralph, art thou content
to have Elinor to thy lady?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Ay, so she will promise me two things.</p>

<p><i>K. of Cast.</i> What's that, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> That she will never scold with Ned, nor fight
with me.&mdash;Sirrah Harry, I have put her down with a
thing unpossible.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> What's that, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, Harry, didst thou ever see that a woman
could both hold her tongue and her hands? No! but
when egg-pies grow on apple-trees, then will thy grey
mare prove a bag-piper.</p>

<p><i>Emp.</i> What say the Lord of Castile and the Earl of
Lincoln, that they are in such earnest and secret talk?</p>

<p>
<i>K. of Cast.</i> I stand, my lord, amazèd at his talk,<br />
How he discourseth of the constancy<br />
Of one surnam'd, for beauty's excellence,<br />
The Fair Maid of merry Fressingfield.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> 'Tis true, my lord, 'tis wondrous for to hear;<br />
Her beauty passing Mars's paramour,<br />
Her virgin's right as rich as Vesta's was:<br />
Lacy and Ned have told me miracles.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Cast.</i> What says Lord Lacy? shall she be his wife?<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Or else Lord Lacy is unfit to live.&mdash;<br />
May it please your highness give me leave to post<br />
To Fressingfield, I'll fetch the bonny girl,<br />
And prove in true appearance at the court,<br />
What I have vouchèd often with my tongue.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> Lacy, go to the 'querry of my stable,<br />
And take such coursers as shall fit thy turn:<br />
Hie thee to Fressingfield, and bring home the lass:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>And, for her fame flies through the English coast,<br />
If it may please the Lady Elinor,<br />
One day shall match your excellence and her.<br />
<br />
<i>Elin.</i> We Castile ladies are not very coy;<br />
Your highness may command a greater boon:<br />
And glad were I to grace the Lincoln Earl<br />
With being partner of his marriage-day.<br />
<br />
<i>P. Edw.</i> Gramercy, Nell, for I do love the lord,<br />
As he that's second to myself in love.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> You love her?&mdash;Madam Nell, never believe
him you, though he swears he loves you.</p>

<p><i>Elin.</i> Why, Ralph?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Why, his love is like unto a tapster's glass that
is broken with every touch; for he loved the fair maid
of Fressingfield once out of all ho.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>&mdash;Nay, Ned, never
wink upon me: I care not, I.</p>

<p>
<i>K. Hen.</i> Ralph tells all; you shall have a good secretary of him.&mdash;<br />
But, Lacy, haste thee post to Fressingfield;<br />
For ere thou hast fitted all things for her state,<br />
The solemn marriage-day will be at hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> I go, my lord. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Emp.</i> How shall we pass this day, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>K. Hen.</i> To horse, my lord; the day is passing fair:<br />
We'll fly the partridge, or go rouse the deer.<br />
Follow, my lords; you shall not want for sport.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Friar Bacon's</span> <i>Cell</i>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter, to</i> <span class="smcap">Friar Bacon</span> <i>in his cell,</i> <span class="smcap">Friar Bungay</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Bun.</i> What means the friar that frolick'd it of late,<br />
To sit as melancholy in his cell,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>As if he had neither lost nor won to-day?<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Ah, Bungay, my Brazen Head is spoil'd,<br />
My glory gone, my seven years' study lost!<br />
The fame of Bacon, bruited through the world,<br />
Shall end and perish with this deep disgrace.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Bacon hath built foundation of his fame<br />
So surely on the wings of true report,<br />
With acting strange and uncouth miracles,<br />
As this cannot infringe what he deserves.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Bungay, sit down, for by prospective skill<br />
I find this day shall fall out ominous:<br />
Some deadly act shall 'tide me ere I sleep:<br />
But what and wherein little can I guess,<br />
My mind is heavy, whatso'er shall hap.<br />
[<i>Knocking within.</i><br />
Who's that knocks?<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> Two scholars that desire to speak with you.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Bid them come in.&mdash;<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter two</i> Scholars.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Now, my youths, what would you have?<br />
<br />
<i>First Schol.</i> Sir, we are Suffolkmen and neighbouring friends:<br />
Our fathers in their countries lusty squires;<br />
Their lands adjoin: in Cratfield mine doth dwell,<br />
And his in Laxfield. We are college-mates,<br />
Sworn brothers, as our fathers live as friends.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> To what end is all this?<br />
<br />
<i>Second Schol.</i> Hearing your worship kept within your cell<br />
A glass prospective, wherein men might see<br />
Whatso their thoughts or hearts' desire could wish,<br />
We come to know how that our fathers fare.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> My glass is free for every honest man.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Sit down, and you shall see ere long,<br />
How or in what state your friendly fathers live.<br />
Meanwhile, tell me your names.<br />
<br />
<i>First Schol.</i> Mine Lambert.<br />
<br />
<i>Second Schol.</i> And mine Serlsby.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Bungay, I smell there will be a tragedy.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Serlsby</span>, <i>with rapiers and daggers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lam.</i> Serlsby, thou hast kept thine hour like a man:<br />
Thou'rt worthy of the title of a squire,<br />
That durst, for proof of thy affection<br />
And for thy mistress' favour, prize<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> thy blood.<br />
Thou know'st what words did pass at Fressingfield,<br />
Such shameless braves as manhood cannot brook:<br />
Ay, for I scorn to bear such piercing taunts,<br />
Prepare thee, Serlsby; one of us will die.<br />
<br />
<i>Serl.</i> Thou see'st I single [meet] thee [in] the field,<br />
And what I spake, I'll maintain with my sword:<br />
Stand on thy guard, I cannot scold it out.<br />
And if thou kill me, think I have a son,<br />
That lives in Oxford in the Broadgates-hall,<br />
Who will revenge his father's blood with blood.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> And, Serlsby, I have there a lusty boy,<br />
That dares at weapon buckle with thy son,<br />
And lives in Broadgates too, as well as thine:<br />
But draw thy rapier, for we'll have a bout.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Now, lusty younkers, look within the glass,<br />
And tell me if you can discern your sires.<br />
<br />
<i>First Schol.</i> Serlsby, 'tis hard; thy father offers wrong,<br />
To combat with my father in the field.<br />
<br />
<i>Second Schol.</i> Lambert, thou liest, my father's is th' abuse,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>And thou shalt find it, if my father harm.<br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> How goes it, sirs?<br />
<br />
<i>First Schol.</i> Our fathers are in combat hard by Fressingfield.<br />
<br />
<i>Bacon.</i> Sit still, my friends, and see the event.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Why stand'st thou, Serlsby? doubt'st thou of thy life?<br />
A veney,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> man! fair Margaret craves so much.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Serl.</i> Then this for her.</p>

<p><i>First Schol.</i> Ah, well thrust!</p>

<p><i>Second Schol.</i> But mark the ward.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Lambert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Serlsby</span> <i>fight and stab each other.</i></p>

<p><i>Lam.</i> O, I am slain! [<i>Dies.</i></p>

<p><i>Serl.</i> And I,&mdash;Lord have mercy on me! [<i>Dies.</i></p>

<p><i>First Schol.</i> My father slain!&mdash;Serlsby, ward that.</p>

<p><i>Second Schol.</i> And so is mine!&mdash;Lambert, I'll quite
thee well.<br />
[<i>The two</i> Scholars <i>stab each other and die.</i></p>

<p><i>Bun.</i> O strange stratagem!</p>

<p>
<i>Bacon.</i> See, friar, where the fathers<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> both lie dead!&mdash;<br />
Bacon, thy magic doth effect this massacre:<br />
This glass prospective worketh many woes;<br />
And therefore seeing these brave lusty Brutes,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a><br />
These friendly youths, did perish by thine art,<br />
End all thy magic and thine art at once.<br />
The poniard that did end their fatal lives,<br />
Shall break the cause efficient of their woes.<br />
So fade the glass, and end with it the shows<br />
That necromancy did infuse the crystal with.<br />
[<i>Breaks the glass.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Bun.</i> What means learn'd Bacon thus to break his glass?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span><i>Bacon.</i> I tell thee, Bungay, it repents me sore<br />
That ever Bacon meddled in this art.<br />
The hours I have spent in pyromantic spells,<br />
The fearful tossing in the latest night<br />
Of papers full of necromantic charms,<br />
Conjuring and adjuring devils and fiends,<br />
With stole and alb and strange pentageron;<br />
The wresting of the holy name of God,<br />
As Soter, Eloim, and Adonai,<br />
Alpha, Manoth, and Tetragrammaton,<br />
With praying to the five-fold powers of heaven,<br />
Are instances that Bacon must be damn'd,<br />
For using devils to countervail his God.&mdash;<br />
Yet, Bacon, cheer thee, drown not in despair:<br />
Sins have their salves, repentance can do much:<br />
Think Mercy sits where Justice holds her seat,<br />
And from those wounds those bloody Jews did pierce,<br />
Which by thy magic oft did bleed afresh,<br />
From thence for thee the dew of mercy drops,<br />
To wash the wrath of high Jehovah's ire,<br />
And make thee as a new-born babe from sin.&mdash;<br />
Bungay, I'll spend the remnant of my life<br />
In pure devotion, praying to my God<br />
That he would save what Bacon vainly lost.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Meadow near the Keepers Lodge.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>in nun's apparel, the</i> Keeper, <i>and their</i>
Friend.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Keeper.</i> Margaret, be not so headstrong in these vows:<br />
O, bury not such beauty in a cell,<br />
That England hath held famous for the hue!<br />
Thy father's hair, like to the silver blooms<br />
That beautify the shrubs of Africa,<br />
Shall fall before the dated time of death,<br />
Thus to forgo his lovely Margaret.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Ah, father, when the harmony of heaven<br />
Soundeth the measures of a lively faith,<br />
The vain illusions of this flattering world<br />
Seem odious to the thoughts of Margaret.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>I lovèd once,&mdash;Lord Lacy was my love;<br />
And now I hate myself for that I lov'd,<br />
And doted more on him than on my God:<br />
For this I scourge myself with sharp repents.<br />
But now the touch of such aspiring sins<br />
Tells me all love is lust but love of heavens;<br />
That beauty us'd for love is vanity:<br />
The world contains naught but alluring baits,<br />
Pride, flattery, and inconstant thoughts.<br />
To shun the pricks of death, I leave the world,<br />
And vow to meditate on heavenly bliss,<br />
To live in Framlingham a holy nun,<br />
Holy and pure in conscience and in deed;<br />
And for to wish all maids to learn of me<br />
To seek heaven's joy before earth's vanity.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Friend.</i> And will you then, Margaret, be shorn a nun,
and so leave us all?</p>

<p>
<i>Mar.</i> Now farewell, world, the engine of all woe!<br />
Farewell to friends and father! welcome Christ!<br />
Adieu to dainty robes! this base attire<br />
Better befits an humble mind to God<br />
Than all the show of rich habiliments.<br />
Farewell, O love, and, with fond love, farewell<br />
Sweet Lacy, whom I lovèd once so dear!<br />
Ever be well, but never in my thoughts,<br />
Lest I offend to think on Lacy's love:<br />
But even to that, as to the rest, farewell!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lacy, Warren</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ermsby</span>, <i>booted and spurred.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lacy.</i> Come on, my wags, we're near the Keeper's lodge.<br />
Here have I oft walk'd in the watery meads,<br />
And chatted with my lovely Margaret.<br />
</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Sirrah Ned, is not this the Keeper?</p>

<p><i>Lacy.</i> 'Tis the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Erms.</i> The old lecher hath gotten holy mutton<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> to
him; a nun, my lord.</p>

<p>
<i>Lacy.</i> Keeper, how far'st thou? holla, man, what cheer?<br />
How doth Peggy, thy daughter and my love?<br />
<br />
<i>Keeper.</i> Ah, good my lord! O, woe is me for Peggy!<br />
See where she stands clad in her nun's attire,<br />
Ready for to be shorn in Framlingham:<br />
She leaves the world because she left your love.<br />
O, good my lord, persuade her if you can!<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Why, how now, Margaret! what, a malcontent?<br />
A nun? what holy father taught you this,<br />
To task yourself to such a tedious life<br />
As die a maid? 'twere injury to me<br />
To smother up such beauty in a cell.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Lord Lacy, thinking of my former miss,<br />
How fond the prime of wanton years were spent<br />
In love (O, fie upon that fond conceit,<br />
Whose hap and essence hangeth in the eye!),<br />
I leave both love and love's content at once,<br />
Betaking me to him that is true love,<br />
And leaving all the world for love of him.<br />
<br />
<i>Lacy.</i> Whence, Peggy, comes this metamorphosis?<br />
What, shorn a nun, and I have from the court<br />
Posted with coursers to convey thee hence<br />
To Windsor, where our marriage shall be kept!<br />
Thy wedding robes are in the tailor's hands.<br />
Come, Peggy, leave these peremptory vows.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Friar Bacon's</span> <i>Cell.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Devil.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Dev.</i> How restless are the ghosts of hellish spirits,<br />
When every charmer with his magic spells,<br />
Calls us from nine-fold-trenchèd Phlegethon,<br />
To scud and over-scour the earth in post<br />
Upon the speedy wings of swiftest winds!<br />
Now Bacon hath rais'd me from the darkest deep,<br />
To search about the world for Miles his man,<br />
For Miles, and to torment his lazy bones<br />
For careless watching of his Brazen Head.<br />
See where he comes: O, he is mine!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>in a gown and a corner-cap.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miles.</i> A scholar, quoth you! marry, sir, I would I
had been made a bottle-maker when I was made a
scholar; for I can get neither to be a deacon, reader,
nor schoolmaster, no, not the clerk of a parish. Some
call me dunce; another saith, my head is as full of Latin
as an egg's full of oatmeal: thus I am tormented, that
the devil and Friar Bacon haunt me.&mdash;Good Lord,
here's one of my master's devils! I'll go speak to him.&mdash;What,
Master Plutus, how cheer you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Dost thou know me?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Know you, sir! why, are not you one of my
master's devils, that were wont to come to my master,
Doctor Bacon, at Brazen-nose?</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Yes, marry, am I.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Good Lord, Master Plutus, I have seen you a
thousand times at my master's, and yet I had never the
manners to make you drink. But, sir, I am glad to see
how conformable you are to the statute.&mdash;I warrant you,
he's as yeomanly a man as you shall see: mark you,
masters, here's a plain, honest man, without welt or
guard.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>&mdash;But I pray you, sir, do you come lately from
hell?</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Ay, marry: how then?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Faith, 'tis a place I have desired long to see:
have you not good tippling-houses there? may not a
man have a lusty fire there, a pot of good ale, a pair<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> of
cards, a swinging piece of chalk, and a brown toast that
will clap a white waistcoat on a cup of good drink?</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> All this you may have there.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> You are for me, friend, and I am for you.
But I pray you, may I not have an office there?</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Yes, a thousand: what would'st thou be?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> By my troth, sir, in a place where I may profit
myself. I know hell is a hot place, and men are
marvellous dry, and much drink is spent there; I would
be a tapster.</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Thou shalt.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> There's nothing lets me from going with
you, but that 'tis a long journey, and I have never
a horse.</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Thou shalt ride on my back.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Now surely here's a courteous devil, that, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to pleasure his friend, will not stick to make a jade of
himself.&mdash;But I pray you, goodman friend, let me move
a question to you.</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> I pray you, whether is your pace a trot or an
amble?</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> An amble.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> 'Tis well; but take heed it be not a trot: but
'tis no matter, I'll prevent it. [<i>Puts on spurs.</i></p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> What dost?</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Marry, friend, I put on my spurs; for if I find
your pace either a trot or else uneasy, I'll put you to a
false gallop; I'll make you feel the benefit of my spurs.</p>

<p><i>Dev.</i> Get up upon my back.
[<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>mounts on the</i> Devil's <i>back.</i></p>

<p>Three of Greene's plays, <i>A Looking-Glass, Orlando Furioso</i> and
<i>Friar Bacon</i>, are known to have been printed in 1594. Two plays,
<i>James IV.</i> and <i>Friar Bacon</i>, were entered on the Stationers'
Registers on the same day, 14th May 1594. It is altogether probable
that the first printing of <i>James IV.</i> occurred in the same year,
though no trace of such an edition has been found. The earliest
extant Quarto is dated 1598, and was printed by Thomas Creede.
Of this two copies are known, one in the British Museum and one
in the South Kensington Museum. Lowndes records a reprint
of 1599, but none such has been discovered. The play is not
mentioned by Henslowe, and there is no record of its performance.
The text of the Quarto of 1598 is in very poor state, and shows
indications that the play was either published from a stage copy or
that type was set by dictation. In V. 3, the King of England is
called Arius, though elsewhere he is given his own title. In II. 2
and III. 2, Ateukin is called Gnatho; in V. 2, Ateukin and Gnatho
appear together. This last duplication of Ateukin and his
Terentian prototype is held by Fleay to indicate another hand in
the composition of the play. Gnatho here, however, stands instead
of Jaques. It should be noticed that in the original story by
Cinthio, the Capitano is equivalent to both Ateukin and Jaques.
The confusion probably arose then from an uncertainty in Greene's
mind as to names rather than from double authorship. In the
hasty first composition Greene probably used the well-known
dramatic type-name for "sycophant," and was later careless in
substituting the name of his choice. The plot of the play is taken,
as indicated by Mr P. A. Daniel in 1881, from the first novel of the
third decade of Cinthio's <i>Hecatommithi</i>. The play makes no pretence
to historical accuracy, and the title itself, in so far as it refers
to Flodden Field, is misleading. Nevertheless the play is by
some held to be "the finest Elizabethan historical play outside of
Shakespeare." By its acted prologue and interplay it served as a
model for Shakespeare's <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> and <i>Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>.</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> This, then,&mdash;thou weart best be gone first; for
ay'l so lop thy limbs that thou's go with half a knave's

<p><i>Ober.</i> Draw it out: now strike, fool, canst thou not?</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Bread ay gad, what de'il is in me? Whay, tell
me, thou skipjack, what art thou?</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> Nay, first tell me what thou wast from thy birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
what thou hast passed hitherto, why thou dwellest in a
tomb and leavest the world; and then I will release thee
of these bonds; before, not.</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> And not before! then needs must, needs sall.
I was born a gentleman of the best blood in all Scotland,
except the king. When time brought me to age, and
death took my parents, I became a courtier; where, though
ay list not praise myself, ay engraved the memory of
Bohan on the skin-coat of some of them, and revelled
with the proudest.</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> But why, living in such reputation, didst thou
leave to be a courtier?</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Because my pride was vanity, my expense loss,
my reward fair words and large promises, and my hopes
spilt; for that after many years' service one outran me;
and what the de'il should I then do there? No, no;
flattering knaves, that can cog and prate fastest, speed
best in the court.</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> To what life didst thou then betake thee?</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> I then changed the court for the country, and
the wars for a wife: but I found the craft of swains more
vile than the knavery of courtiers, the charge of children
more heavy than servants, and wives' tongues worse than
the wars itself; and therefore I gave o'er that, and went
to the city to dwell; and there I kept a great house with
small cheer, but all was ne'er the near.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> And why?</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Because, in seeking friends, I found table-guests
to eat me and my meat, my wife's gossips to bewray the
secrets of my heart, kindred to betray the effect of my
life: which when I noted,&mdash;the court ill, the country
worse, and the city worst of all,&mdash;in good time my wife
died, ay would she had died twenty winter sooner, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

shutting myself into this tomb, where, if I die, I am sure
I am safe from wild beasts, but, whilst I live, cannot be
free from ill company. Besides, now I am sure, gif all
my friends fail me, I sall have a grave of mine own providing.
This is all. Now, what art thou?</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> Oberon, King of Fairies, that loves thee because
thou hatest the world; and, to gratulate thee, I brought
these antics to show thee some sport in dancing, which
thou hast loved well.</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Ha, ha, ha! thinkest thou those puppets can
please me? whay, I have two sons, that with one Scottish
jig shall break the necks of thy antics.</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> That I would fain see.</p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Why, thou shalt.&mdash;Ho, boys!</p>

call upon me, to help him. Now let them go.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Slipper</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nano</span> <i>with courtesies.</i></p>

<p><i>Boh.</i> Now, king, if thou be a king, I will show thee
whay I hate the world by demonstration. In the year
fifteen hundred and twenty, was in Scotland a king,
over-ruled with parasites, misled by lust, and many
circumstances too long to trattle on now, much like our
court of Scotland this day. That story have I set down.
Gang with me to the gallery, and I'll show thee the same
in action by guid fellows of our country-men; and then,
when thou see'st that, judge if any wise man would not
leave the world if he could.</p>

<p><i>Ober.</i> That will I see: lead, and I'll follow thee.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<h3>ACT THE FIRST</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Court at Edinburgh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">King of England</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Scots,
Queen Dorothea</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Countess of Arran,
Ida</span>, <i>and</i> Lords; <i>with them</i> <span class="smcap">Ateukin</span>, <i>aloof.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Brother of England, since our neighbouring lands<br />
And near alliance do invite our loves,<br />
The more I think upon our last accord,<br />
The more I grieve your sudden parting hence.<br />
First, laws of friendship did confirm our peace;<br />
Now both the seal of faith and marriage-bed,<br />
The name of father, and the style of friend;<br />
These force in me affection full confirm'd;<br />
So that I grieve&mdash;and this my hearty grief<br />
The heavens record, the world may witness well&mdash;<br />
To lose your presence, who are now to me<br />
A father, brother, and a vowèd friend.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span><i>K. of Eng.</i> Link all these lovely styles, good king, in one:<br />
And since thy grief exceeds in my depart,<br />
I leave my Dorothea to enjoy<br />
Thy whole compact [of] loves and plighted vows.<br />
Brother of Scotland, this is my joy, my life,<br />
Her father's honour, and her country's hope,<br />
Her mother's comfort, and her husband's bliss:<br />
I tell thee, king, in loving of my Doll,<br />
Thou bind'st her father's heart, and all his friends,<br />
In bands of love that death cannot dissolve.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Nor can her father love her like to me,<br />
My life's light, and the comfort of my soul.&mdash;<br />
Fair Dorothea, that wast England's pride,<br />
Welcome to Scotland; and, in sign of love,<br />
Lo, I invest thee with the Scottish crown.&mdash;<br />
Nobles and ladies, stoop unto your queen,<br />
And trumpets sound, that heralds may proclaim<br />
Fair Dorothea peerless Queen of Scots.<br />
<br />
<i>All.</i> Long live and prosper our fair Queen of Scots!<br />
[<i>They install and crown her.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Thanks to the King of Kings for my dignity,<br />
Thanks to my father, that provides so carefully;<br />
Thanks to my lord and husband for this honour;<br />
And thanks to all that love their king and me.<br />
<br />
<i>All.</i> Long live fair Dorothea, our true queen!<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Eng.</i> Long shine the sun of Scotland in her pride,<br />
Her father's comfort, and fair Scotland's bride!<br />
But, Dorothea, since I must depart,<br />
And leave thee from thy tender mother's charge,<br />
Let me advise my lovely daughter first<br />
What best befits her in a foreign land.<br />
Live, Doll, for many eyes shall look on thee<br />
With care of honour and the present state;<br />
For she that steps to height of majesty<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>Is even the mark whereat the enemy aims:<br />
Thy virtues shall be construèd to vice,<br />
Thine affable discourse to abject mind;<br />
If coy, detracting tongues will call thee proud:<br />
Be therefore wary in this slippery state;<br />
Honour thy husband, love him as thy life,<br />
Make choice of friends&mdash;as eagles of their young&mdash;<br />
Who soothe no vice, who flatter not for gain,<br />
But love such friends as do the truth maintain.<br />
Think on these lessons when thou art alone,<br />
And thou shalt live in health when I am gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> I will engrave these precepts in my heart:<br />
And as the wind with calmness wooes you hence,<br />
Even so I wish the heavens, in all mishaps,<br />
May bless my father with continual grace.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Eng.</i> Then, son, farewell:<br />
The favouring winds invite us to depart.<br />
Long circumstance in taking princely leaves<br />
Is more officious than convenient.<br />
Brother of Scotland, love me in my child:<br />
You greet me well, if so you will her good.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Then, lovely Doll, and all that favour me,<br />
Attend to see our English friends at sea:<br />
Let all their charge depend upon my purse:<br />
They are our neighbours, by whose kind accord<br />
We dare attempt the proudest potentate.<br />
Only, fair countess, and your daughter, stay;<br />
With you I have some other thing to say.<br />
[<i>Exeunt, in all royalty, the</i> <span class="smcap">King of England,
Queen Dorothea</span> <i>and</i> Lords.<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. So let them triumph that have cause to joy:<br />
But, wretched king, thy nuptial knot is death,<br />
Thy bride the breeder of thy country's ill;<br />
For thy false heart dissenting from thy hand,<br />
Misled by love, hath made another choice,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>Another choice, even when thou vow'd'st thy soul<br />
To Dorothea, England's choicest pride.<br />
O, then thy wandering eyes bewitch'd thy heart!<br />
Even in the chapel did thy fancy change,<br />
When, perjur'd man, though fair Doll had thy hand,<br />
The Scottish Ida's beauty stale thy heart:<br />
Yet fear and love have tied thy ready tongue<br />
From babbling forth the passions of thy mind,<br />
'Less fearful silence have in subtle looks<br />
Bewray'd the treason of my new-vow'd love.<br />
Be fair and lovely, Doll; but here's the prize,<br />
That lodgeth here, and enter'd through mine eyes:<br />
Yet, howso'er I love, I must be wise.&mdash;<br />
Now, lovely countess, what reward or grace<br />
May I employ on you for this your zeal,<br />
And humble honours, done us in our court,<br />
In entertainment of the English king?<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> It was of duty, prince, that I have done;<br />
And what in favour may content me most,<br />
Is, that it please your grace to give me leave<br />
For to return unto my country-home.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> But, lovely Ida, is your mind the same?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> I count of court, my lord, as wise men do,<br />
'Tis fit for those that know what 'longs thereto:<br />
Each person to his place; the wise to art,<br />
The cobbler to his clout, the swain to cart.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> But, Ida, you are fair, and beauty shines,<br />
And seemeth best, where pomp her pride refines.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> If beauty, as I know there's none in me,<br />
Were sworn my love, and I his life should be,<br />
The farther from the court I were remov'd,<br />
The more, I think, of heaven I were belov'd.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> And why?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Because the court is counted Venus' net,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>Where gifts and vows for stales<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> are often set:<br />
None, be she chaste as Vesta, but shall meet<br />
A curious tongue to charm her ears with sweet.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Why, Ida, then I see you set at naught<br />
The force of love.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> In sooth, this is my thought,<br />
Most gracious king,&mdash;that they that little prove,<br />
Are mickle blest, from bitter sweets of love.<br />
And weel I wot, I heard a shepherd sing,<br />
That, like a bee, love hath a little sting:<br />
He lurks in flowers, he percheth on the trees,<br />
He on kings' pillows bends his pretty knees;<br />
The boy is blind, but when he will not spy,<br />
He hath a leaden foot and wings to fly:<br />
Beshrew me yet, for all these strange effects,<br />
If I would like the lad that so infects.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> [<i>aside</i>].<br />
Rare wit, fair face, what heart could more desire?<br />
But Doll is fair and doth concern thee near:<br />
Let Doll be fair, she is won; but I must woo<br />
And win fair Ida; there's some choice in two.&mdash;<br />
But, Ida, thou art coy.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> And why, dread king?<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> In that you will dispraise so sweet a thing<br />
As love. Had I my wish&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> What then?<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Then would I place<br />
His arrow here, his beauty in that face.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> And were Apollo mov'd and rul'd by me,<br />
His wisdom should be yours, and mine his tree.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> But here returns our train.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Queen Dorothea</span> <i>and</i> Lords.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Welcome, fair Doll!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>How fares our father? is he shipp'd and gone?<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> My royal father is both shipp'd and gone:<br />
God and fair winds direct him to his home!<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Amen, say I.&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>]. Would thou wert with him too!<br />
Then might I have a fitter time to woo.&mdash;<br />
But, countess, you would be gone, therefore, farewell,&mdash;<br />
Yet, Ida, if thou wilt, stay thou behind<br />
To accompany my queen:<br />
But if thou like the pleasures of the court,&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. Or if she lik'd me, though she left the court,&mdash;<br />
What should I say? I know not what to say.&mdash;<br />
You may depart:&mdash;and you, my courteous queen,<br />
Leave me a space; I have a weighty cause<br />
To think upon:&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>]. Ida, it nips me near;<br />
It came from thence, I feel it burning here.<br />
[<i>Exeunt all except the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Scots</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ateukin</span>.<br />
Now am I free from sight of common eye,<br />
Where to myself I may disclose the grief<br />
That hath too great a part in mine affects.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. And now is my time by wiles and words to rise,<br />
Greater than those that think themselves more wise.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> And first, fond king, thy honour doth engrave<br />
Upon thy brows the drift of thy disgrace.<br />
Thy new-vow'd love, in sight of God and men,<br />
Links thee to Dorothea during life;<br />
For who more fair and virtuous than thy wife?<br />
Deceitful murderer of a quiet mind,<br />
Fond love, vile lust, that thus misleads us men<br />
To vow our faiths, and fall to sin again!<br />
But kings stoop not to every common thought:<br />
Ida is fair and wise, fit for a king;<br />
And for fair Ida will I hazard life,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>Venture my kingdom, country, and my crown:<br />
Such fire hath love to burn a kingdom down.<br />
Say Doll dislikes that I estrange my love:<br />
Am I obedient to a woman's look?<br />
Nay, say her father frown when he shall hear<br />
That I do hold fair Ida's love so dear:<br />
Let father frown and fret, and fret and die,<br />
Nor earth nor heaven shall part my love and I.&mdash;<br />
Yea, they shall part us, but we first must meet,<br />
And woo and win, and yet the world not see't.&mdash;<br />
Yea, there's the wound, and wounded with that thought,<br />
So let me die, for all my drift is naught!<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Most gracious and imperial majesty,&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. A little flattery more were but too much.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Villain, what art thou<br />
That thus dar'st interrupt a prince's secrets?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Dread king, thy vassal is a man of art,<br />
Who knows, by constellation of the stars,<br />
By oppositions and by dire aspécts,<br />
The things are past and those that are to come.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> But where's thy warrant to approach my presence?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> My zeal, and ruth to see your grace's wrong,<br />
Make me lament I did detract<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> so long.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> If thou know'st thoughts, tell me, what mean I now?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> I'll calculate the cause<br />
Of those your highness' smiles, and tell your thoughts.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> But lest thou spend thy time in idleness,<br />
And miss the matter that my mind aims at,<br />
Tell me: what star was opposite when that was thought?<br />
[<i>Strikes him on the ear.</i><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span><i>Ateu.</i> 'Tis inconvenient, mighty potentate,<br />
Whose looks resemble Jove in majesty,<br />
To scorn the sooth of science with contempt.<br />
I see in those imperial looks of yours<br />
The whole discourse of love: Saturn combust,<br />
With direful looks, at your nativity<br />
Beheld fair Venus in her silver orb:<br />
I know, by certain axioms I have read,<br />
Your grace's griefs, and further can express<br />
Her name that holds you thus in fancy's bands.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Thou talkest wonders.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Naught but truth, O king.<br />
'Tis Ida is the mistress of your heart,<br />
Whose youth must take impression of affects;<br />
For tender twigs will bow, and milder minds<br />
Will yield to fancy, be they follow'd well.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> What god art thou, compos'd in human shape,<br />
Or bold Trophonius, to decide our doubts?<br />
How know'st thou this?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Even as I know the means<br />
To work your grace's freedom and your love.<br />
Had I the mind, as many courtiers have,<br />
To creep into your bosom for your coin,<br />
And beg rewards for every cap and knee,<br />
I then would say, "If that your grace would give<br />
This lease, this manor, or this patent seal'd,<br />
For this or that I would effect your love:"<br />
But Ateukin is no parasite, O prince.<br />
I know your grace knows scholars are but poor;<br />
And therefore, as I blush to beg a fee,<br />
Your mightiness is so magnificent,<br />
You cannot choose but cast some gift apart,<br />
To ease my bashful need that cannot beg.<br />
As for your love, O, might I be employ'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>How faithfully would Ateukin compass it!<br />
But princes rather trust a smoothing tongue<br />
Than men of art that can accept the time.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Ateukin,&mdash;if so thy name, for so thou say'st,&mdash;<br />
Thine art appears in entrance of my love;<br />
And, since I deem thy wisdom match'd with truth,<br />
I will exalt thee; and thyself alone<br />
Shalt be the agent to dissolve my grief.<br />
Sooth is, I love, and Ida is my love;<br />
But my new marriage nips me near, Ateukin,<br />
For Dorothea may not brook th' abuse.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> These lets are but as motes against the sun,<br />
Yet not so great; like dust before the wind,<br />
Yet not so light. Tut, pacify your grace:<br />
You have the sword and sceptre in your hand;<br />
You are the king, the state depends on you;<br />
Your will is law. Say that the case were mine:<br />
Were she my sister whom your highness loves,<br />
She should consent, for that our lives, our goods,<br />
Depend on you; and if your queen repine,<br />
Although my nature cannot brook of blood,<br />
And scholars grieve to hear of murderous deeds,&mdash;<br />
But if the lamb should let the lion's way,<br />
By my advice the lamb should lose her life.<br />
Thus am I bold to speak unto your grace,<br />
Who am too base to kiss your royal feet;<br />
For I am poor, nor have I land nor rent,<br />
Nor countenance here in court; but for my love,<br />
Your grace shall find none such within the realm.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Wilt thou effect my love? shall she be mine?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> I'll gather moly, crocus, and the herbs<br />
That heal the wounds of body and the mind;<br />
I'll set out charms and spells; naught else shall be left<br />
To tame the wanton if she shall rebel:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>Give me but tokens of your highness' trust.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Thou shalt have gold, honour, and wealth enough;<br />
Win my love, and I will make thee great.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> These words do make me rich, most noble prince;<br />
I am more proud of them than any wealth.<br />
Did not your grace suppose I flatter you,<br />
Believe me, I would boldly publish this;&mdash;<br />
Was never eye that saw a sweeter face,<br />
Nor never ear that heard a deeper wit:<br />
O God, how I am ravish'd in your worth!<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Ateukin, follow me; love must have ease.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> I'll kiss your highness' feet; march when you please.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Public Place in Edinburgh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Slipper, Nano</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew</span>, <i>with their bills,
ready written, in their hands.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>And.</i> Stand back, sir; mine shall stand highest.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Come under mine arm, sir, or get a footstool;
or else, by the light of the moon, I must come to it.</p>

<p><i>Nano.</i> Agree, my masters; every man to his height:
though I stand lowest, I hope to get the best master.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Ere I will stoop to a thistle, I will change turns;
as good luck comes on the right hand as the left: here's
for me.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> And me.</p>

<p><i>Nano.</i> And mine. [<i>They set up their bills.</i></p>

<p><i>And.</i> But tell me, fellows, till better occasion come,
do you seek masters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Slip. Nano.</i> We do.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> But what can you do worthy preferment?</p>

<p><i>Nano.</i> Marry, I can smell a knave from a rat.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> And I can lick a dish before a cat.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> And I can find two fools unsought,&mdash;how like
you that?</p>

<p>But, in earnest now, tell me: of what trades are you two?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> How mean you that, sir, of what trade? Marry,
I'll tell you, I have many trades: the honest trade when
I needs must; the filching trade when time serves; the
cozening trade as I find occasion. And I have more
qualities: I cannot abide a full cup unkissed, a fat capon
uncarved, a full purse unpicked, nor a fool to prove a
justice as you do.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Why, sot, why callest thou me fool?</p>

<p><i>Nano.</i> For examining wiser than thyself.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> So doth many more than I in Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Nano.</i> Yea, those are such as have more authority
than wit, and more wealth than honesty.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> This is my little brother with the great wit;
'ware him!&mdash;But what canst thou do, tell me, that art so
inquisitive of us?</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Anything that concerns a gentleman to do, that
can I do.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> So you are of the gentle trade?</p>

<p><i>And.</i> True.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Then, gentle sir, leave us to ourselves, for here
comes one as if he would lack a servant ere he went.
[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>stands aside.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ateukin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Why, so, Ateukin, this becomes thee best:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>Wealth, honour, ease, and angels in thy chest.<br />
Now may I say, as many often sing,<br />
"No fishing to<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> the sea, nor service to a king."<br />
Unto this high promotion doth belong<br />
Means to be talk'd of in the thickest throng.<br />
And first, to fit the humours of my lord,<br />
Sweet lays and lines of love I must record;<br />
And such sweet lines and love-lays I'll indite,<br />
As men may wish for, and my liege delight:<br />
And next, a train of gallants at my heels,<br />
That men may say, the world doth run on wheels;<br />
For men of art, that rise by indirection<br />
To honour and the favour of their king,<br />
Must use all means to save what they have got,<br />
And win their favours whom they never knew.<br />
If any frown to see my fortunes such,<br />
A man must bear a little,&mdash;not too much!<br />
But, in good time!&mdash;these bills portend, I think,<br />
That some good fellows do for service seek. [<i>Reads.</i><br />
<i>If any gentleman, spiritual or temporal, will entertain
out of his service, a young stripling of the age of thirty
years, that can sleep with the soundest, eat with the
hungriest, work with the sickest, lie with the loudest, face
with the proudest, etc., that can wait in a gentleman's
chamber when his master is a mile off, keep his stable
when 'tis empty, and his purse when 'tis full, and hath
many qualities worse than all these, let him write his
name and go his way, and attendance shall be given.</i><br />
By my faith, a good servant: which is he?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Truly, sir, that am I.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> And why dost thou write such a bill? Are all
these qualities in thee?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O Lord, ay, sir, and a great many more, some
better, some worse, some richer, some poorer. Why,
sir, do you look so? do they not please you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Truly, no, for they are naught, and so art thou:
if thou hast no better qualities, stand by.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O, sir, I tell the worst first; but, an you lack a
man, I am for you: I'll tell you the best qualities I have.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Be brief, then.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> If you need me in your chamber, I can keep the
door at a whistle; in your kitchen, turn the spit, and
lick the pan, and make the fire burn; but if in the
stable,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Yea, there would I use thee.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, there you kill me, there am I! and turn
me to a horse and a wench, and I have no peer.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Art thou so good in keeping a horse? I
pray thee, tell me how many good qualities hath a
horse.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, so, sir: a horse hath two properties of a
man, that is, a proud heart, and a hardy stomach; four
properties of a lion, a broad breast, a stiff docket,&mdash;hold
your nose, master,&mdash;a wild countenance, and four good
legs; nine properties of a fox, nine of a hare, nine of an
ass, and ten of a woman.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> A woman! why, what properties of a woman
hath a horse?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O, master, know you not that? Draw your
tables,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and write what wise I speak. First, a merry
countenance; second, a soft pace; third, a broad forehead;
fourth, broad buttocks; fifth, hard of ward; sixth,
easy to leap upon; seventh, good at long journey;
eighth, moving under a man; ninth, always busy with
the mouth; tenth, ever chewing on the bridle.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Thou art a man for me: what's thy name?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> An ancient name, sir, belonging to the chamber
and the night-gown: guess you that.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> What's that? Slipper?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> By my faith, well guessed; and so 'tis indeed.
You'll be my master?</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> I mean so.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Read this first.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> [<i>reads</i>]. <i>Pleaseth it any gentleman to entertain a
servant of more wit than stature, let them subscribe, and

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Bartram</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Eustace</span>, <i>and others,
booted.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Sir Bar.</i> But tell me, lovely Eustace, as thou lov'st me,<br />
Among the many pleasures we have pass'd,<br />
Which is the rifest in thy memory,<br />
To draw thee over to thine ancient friend?<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> What makes Sir Bartram thus inquisitive?<br />
Tell me, good knight, am I welcome or no?<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> By sweet Saint Andrew and may sale<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> I swear,<br />
As welcome is my honest Dick to me<br />
As morning's sun, or as the watery moon<br />
In merkest night, when we the borders track.<br />
I tell thee, Dick, thy sight hath clear'd my thoughts<br />
Of many baneful troubles that there woon'd:<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a><br />
Welcome to Sir Bartram as his life!<br />
Tell me, bonny Dick: hast got a wife?<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> A wife! God shield, Sir Bartram, that were ill,<br />
To leave my wife and wander thus astray:<br />
But time and good advice, ere many years,<br />
May chance to make my fancy bend that way.<br />
What news in Scotland? therefore came I hither,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>To see your country and to chat together.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Why, man, our country's blithe, our king is well,<br />
Our queen so-so, the nobles well and worse,<br />
And weel are they that are about the king,<br />
But better are the country gentlemen:<br />
And I may tell thee, Eustace, in our lives<br />
We old men never saw so wondrous change.<br />
But leave this trattle, and tell me what news<br />
In lovely England with our honest friends.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> The king, the court, and all our noble friends<br />
Are well; and God in mercy keep them so!<br />
The northern lords and ladies hereabouts,<br />
That know I came to see your queen and court,<br />
Commend them to my honest friend Sir Bartram,&mdash;<br />
And many others that I have not seen.<br />
Among the rest, the Countess Elinor,<br />
From Carlisle, where we merry oft have been,<br />
Greets well my lord, and hath directed me,<br />
By message, this fair lady's face to see.<br />
[<i>Shows a portrait.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> I tell thee, Eustace, 'less mine old eyes daze,<br />
This is our Scottish moon and evening's pride;<br />
This is the blemish of your English bride.<br />
Who sail by her, are sure of wind at will;<br />
Her face is dangerous, her sight is ill:<br />
And yet, in sooth, sweet Dick, it may be said,<br />
The king hath folly, there's virtue in the maid.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> But knows my friend this portrait? be advis'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Is it not Ida, the Countess of Arran's daughter's?<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> So was I told by Elinor of Carlisle:<br />
But tell me, lovely Bartram: is the maid<br />
Evil-inclin'd, misled, or concubine<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>Unto the king or any other lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Should I be brief and true, than thus, my Dick:<br />
All England's grounds yield not a blither lass,<br />
Nor Europe can surpass her for her gifts<br />
Of virtue, honour, beauty, and the rest:<br />
But our fond king, not knowing sin in lust,<br />
Makes love by endless means and precious gifts;<br />
And men that see it dare not say't, my friend,<br />
But we may wish that it were otherwise.<br />
But I rid thee to view the picture still,<br />
For by the person's sight there hangs some ill.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> O, good Sir Bartram, you suspect I love<br />
(Then were I mad) her whom I never saw.<br />
But, howsoe'er, I fear not enticings:<br />
Desire will give no place unto a king:<br />
I'll see her whom the world admires so much,<br />
That I may say with them, "There lives none such."<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Be Gad, and sall both see and talk with her;<br />
And, when thou'st done, whate'er her beauty be,<br />
I'll warrant thee her virtues may compare<br />
With the proudest she that waits upon your queen.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> Servant.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Serv.</i> My lady entreats your worship in to supper.</p>

<p>

<h3>ACT THE SECOND</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Porch to the Castle of the</i> <span class="smcap">Countess
of Arran</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Countess of Arran</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ida</span> <i>discovered sitting
at work.</i></p>

<p><i>A Song.</i><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Count. of A.</i> Fair Ida, might you choose the greatest good,<br />
'Midst all the world in blessings that abound,<br />
Wherein, my daughter, should your liking be?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Not in delights, or pomp, or majesty.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> And why?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Since these are means to draw the mind<br />
From perfect good, and make true judgment blind.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> Might you have wealth and fortune's richest store?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Yet would I, might I choose, be honest-poor;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>For she that sits at fortune's feet a-low<br />
Is sure she shall not taste a further woe;<br />
But those that prank on top of fortune's ball<br />
Still fear a change, and, fearing, catch a fall.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> Tut, foolish maid, each one contemneth need.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Good reason why, they know not good indeed.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> Many, marry, then, on whom distress doth lour.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Yes, they that virtue deem an honest dower.<br />
Madam, by right this world I may compare<br />
Unto my work, wherein with heedful care<br />
The heavenly workman plants with curious hand&mdash;<br />
As I with needle draw&mdash;each thing on land<br />
Even as he list: some men like to the rose<br />
Are fashion'd fresh; some in their stalks do close,<br />
And, born, do sudden die; some are but weeds,<br />
And yet from them a secret good proceeds:<br />
I with my needle, if I please, may blot<br />
The fairest rose within my cambric plot;<br />
God with a beck can change each worldly thing,<br />
The poor to earth, the beggar to the king.<br />
What, then, hath man wherein he well may boast,<br />
Since by a beck he lives, a lour<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> is lost?<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> Peace, Ida, here are strangers near at hand.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Eustace</span> <i>with letters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Eust.</i> Madam, God speed!<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> I thank you, gentle squire.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> The country Countess of Northumberland<br />
Doth greet you well; and hath requested me<br />
To bring these letters to your ladyship.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>[<i>Delivers the letters.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> I thank her honour, and yourself, my friend.<br />
[<i>Peruses them.</i><br />
I see she means you good, brave gentleman.&mdash;<br />
Daughter, the Lady Elinor salutes<br />
Yourself as well as me: then for her sake<br />
'Twere good you entertain'd that courtier well.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> As much salute as may become my sex,<br />
And he in virtue can vouchsafe to think,<br />
I yield him for the courteous countess' sake.&mdash;<br />
Good sir, sit down: my mother here and I<br />
Count time misspent an endless vanity.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Beyond report, the wit, the fair, the shape!&mdash;<br />
What work you here, fair mistress? may I see it?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Good sir, look on: how like you this compáct?<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> Methinks in this I see true love in act:<br />
The woodbines with their leaves do sweetly spread,<br />
The roses blushing prank them in their red;<br />
No flower but boasts the beauties of the spring;<br />
This bird hath life indeed, if it could sing.<br />
What means, fair mistress, had you in this work?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> My needle, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> In needles, then, there lurk<br />
Some hidden grace, I deem, beyond my reach.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Not grace in them, good sir, but those that teach.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> Say that your needle now were Cupid's sting,&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. But, ah, her eye must be no less,<br />
In which is heaven and heavenliness,<br />
In which the food of God is shut,<br />
Whose powers the purest minds do glut!<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> What if it were?<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> Then see a wondrous thing;<br />
I fear me you would paint in Tereus' heart<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>Affection in his power and chiefest part.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Good Lord, sir, no! for hearts but prickèd soft<br />
Are wounded sore, for so I hear it oft.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> What recks the wound, where but your happy eye<br />
May make him live whom Jove hath judg'd to die?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Should life and death within this needle lurk,<br />
I'll prick no hearts, I'll prick upon my work.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ateukin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Slipper</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Count. of A.</i> Peace, Ida, I perceive the fox at hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Eust.</i> The fox! why, fetch your hounds, and chase him hence.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> O, sir, these great men bark at small offence.<br />
Come, will it please you enter, gentle sir?<br />
[<i>They offer to go out.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Stay, courteous ladies; favour me so much<br />
As to discourse a word or two apart.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> Good sir, my daughter learns this rule of me,<br />
To shun resort and strangers' company;<br />
For some are shifting mates that carry letters;<br />
Some, such as you, too good because our betters.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Now, I pray you, sir, what akin are you to a
pickerel?</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Why, knave?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> By my troth, sir, because I never knew a proper
situation fellow of your pitch fitter to swallow a gudgeon.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> What meanest thou by this?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> "Shifting fellow," sir,&mdash;these be thy words;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
"shifting fellow": this gentlewoman, I fear me, knew
your bringing up.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> How so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, sir, your father was a miller, that could
shift for a peck of grist in a bushel, and you a fair-spoken
gentleman, that can get more land by a lie than
an honest man by his ready money.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Caitiff, what sayest thou?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> I say, sir, that if she call you shifting knave, you
shall not put her to the proof.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> And why?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Because, sir, living by your wit as you do, shifting
is your letters-patents: it were a hard matter for me to
get my dinner that day wherein my master had not sold
a dozen of devices, a case of cogs, and a suit of shifts,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> in
the morning. I speak this in your commendation, sir,
and, I pray you, so take it.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> If I live, knave, I will be revenged. What
gentleman would entertain a rascal thus to derogate from
his honour? [<i>Beats him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ida.</i> My lord, why are you thus impatient?</p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Not angry, Ida; but I teach this knave<br />
How to behave himself among his betters.&mdash;<br />
Behold, fair countess, to assure your stay,<br />
I here present the signet of the king,<br />
Who now by me, fair Ida, doth salute you:<br />
And since in secret I have certain things<br />
In his behalf, good madam, to impart,<br />
I crave your daughter to discourse apart.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> She shall in humble duty be addrest<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a><br />
To do his highness' will in what she may.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Now, gentle sir, what would his grace with me?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Fair, comely nymph, the beauty of your face,<br />
Sufficient to bewitch the heavenly powers,<br />
Hath wrought so much in him, that now of late<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>He finds himself made captive unto love;<br />
And though his power and majesty require<br />
A straight command before an humble suit,<br />
Yet he his mightiness doth so abase<br />
As to entreat your favour, honest maid.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Is he not married, sir, unto our queen?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> He is.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> And are not they by God accurs'd,<br />
That sever them whom he hath knit in one?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> They be: what then? we seek not to displace<br />
The princess from her seat; but, since by love<br />
The king is made your own, he is resolv'd<br />
In private to accept your dalliance,<br />
In spite of war, watch, or worldly eye.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> O, how he talks, as if he should not die!<br />
As if that God in justice once could wink<br />
Upon that fault I am asham'd to think!<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Tut, mistress, man at first was born to err;<br />
Women are all not formèd to be saints:<br />
'Tis impious for to kill our native king,<br />
Whom by a little favour we may save.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> Better, than live unchaste, to lie in grave.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> He shall erect your state, and wed you well.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> But can his warrant keep my soul from hell?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> He will enforce, if you resist his suit.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> What tho?<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The world may shame to him account,<br />
To be a king of men and worldly pelf,<br />
Yet hath no power to rule and guide himself.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> I know you, gentle lady, and the care<br />
Both of your honour and his grace's health<br />
Makes me confusèd in this dangerous state.<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> So counsel him, but soothe thou not his sin:<br />
'Tis vain allurement that doth make him love:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>I shame to hear, be you asham'd to move.<br />
<br />
<i>Count. of A.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. I see my daughter grows impatient:<br />
I fear me, he pretends some bad intent.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Will you despise the king and scorn him so?<br />
<br />
<i>Ida.</i> In all allegiance I will serve his grace,<br />
But not in lust: O, how I blush to name it!<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. An endless work is this: how should I frame it?<br />
[<i>They discourse privately.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O, mistress, may I turn a word upon you?</p>

<p><i>Count. of A.</i> Friend, what wilt thou?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O, what a happy gentlewoman be you truly! the
world reports this of you, mistress, that a man can no
sooner come to your house but the butler comes with a
black-jack and says, "Welcome, friend, here's a cup of
the best for you": verily, mistress, you are said to have
the best ale in all Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Count. of A.</i> Sirrah, go fetch him drink. [Servant
<i>brings drink</i>]. How likest thou this?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Like it, mistress! why, this is quincy quarie,
pepper de watchet, single goby, of all that ever I tasted!
I'll prove in this ale and toast the compass of the whole
world. First, this is the earth,&mdash;it lies in the middle, a
fair brown toast, a goodly country for hungry teeth to
dwell upon; next, this is the sea, a fair pool for a dry
tongue to fish in: now come I, and, seeing the world is
naught, I divide it thus; and, because the sea cannot stand
without the earth, as Aristotle saith, I put them both
into their first chaos, which is my belly: and so,
mistress, you may see your ale is become a miracle.</p>

<p><i>Eust.</i> A merry mate, madam, I promise you.</p>

<p><i>Count. of A.</i> Why sigh you, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Truly, madam, to think upon the world, which,
since I denounced it, keeps such a rumbling in my
stomach, that, unless your cook give it a counterbuff
with some of your roasted capons or beef, I fear me I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
shall become a loose body, so dainty, I think, I shall
neither hold fast before nor behind.</p>

<p>
<i>Count. of A.</i> Go take him in, and feast this merry swain.&mdash;<br />
Sirrah, my cook is your physician;<br />
He hath a purge for to digest the world.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The Court at Edinburgh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter, one by one, the</i> <span class="smcap">Bishop of St Andrews, Douglas,
Morton</span>, <i>and others, one way</i>; <span class="smcap">Queen Dorothea</span>
<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Nano</span>, <i>another way.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Bp. of St And.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. O wrack of commonweal! O wretched state!<br />
<br />
<i>Doug.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. O hapless flock, whereas the guide is blind!<br />
<br />
<i>Mort.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. O heedless youth, where counsel is despis'd!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>[<i>They are all in a muse.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Come, pretty knave, and prank it by my side;<br />
Let's see your best attendance out of hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Madam, although my limbs are very small,<br />
My heart is good; I'll serve you therewithal.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> How, if I were assail'd, what couldst thou do?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Madam, call help, and boldly fight it too:<br />
Although a bee be but a little thing,<br />
You know, fair queen, it hath a bitter sting.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> How couldst thou do me good, were I in grief?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Counsel, dear princess, is a choice relief:<br />
Though Nestor wanted force, great was his wit;<br />
And though I am but weak, my words are fit.<br />
<br />
<i>Bp. of St And.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Like to a ship upon the ocean-seas,<br />
Tost in the doubtful stream, without a helm,<br />
Such is a monarch without good advice.<br />
I am o'erheard: cast rein upon thy tongue;<br />
Andrews, beware; reproof will breed a scar.<br />
<br />
<i>Mort.</i> Good-day, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Bp. of St And.</i> Lord Morton, well y-met.&mdash;<br />
Whereon deems Lord Douglas all this while?<br />
<br />
<i>Doug.</i> Of that which yours and my poor heart doth break,<br />
Although fear shuts our mouths, we dare not speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. What mean these princes sadly to consult?<br />
Somewhat, I fear, betideth them amiss,<br />
They are so pale in looks, so vex'd in mind.&mdash;<br />
In happy hour, the noble Scottish peers,<br />
Have I encounter'd you: what makes you mourn?<br />
<br />
<i>Bp. of St And.</i> If we with patience may attention gain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>Your grace shall know the cause of all our grief.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Speak on, good father: come and sit by me:<br />
I know thy care is for the common good.<br />
<br />
<i>Bp. of St And.</i> As fortune, mighty princess, reareth some<br />
To high estate and place in commonweal,<br />
So by divine bequest to them is lent<br />
A riper judgment and more searching eye,<br />
Whereby they may discern the common harm;<br />
For where our fortunes in the world are most,<br />
Where all our profits rise and still increase,<br />
There is our mind, thereon we meditate,&mdash;<br />
And what we do partake of good advice,<br />
That we employ for to concern the same.<br />
To this intent, these nobles and myself,<br />
That are, or should be, eyes of commonweal,<br />
Seeing his highness' reckless course of youth,<br />
His lawless and unbridled vein in love,<br />
His too intentive trust to flatterers,<br />
His abject care of counsel and his friends,<br />
Cannot but grieve; and, since we cannot draw<br />
His eye or judgment to discern his faults,<br />
Since we have spoke and counsel is not heard,<br />
I, for my part,&mdash;let others as they list,&mdash;<br />
Will leave the court, and leave him to his will,<br />
Lest with a ruthful eye I should behold<br />
His overthrow, which, sore I fear, is nigh.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, father, are you so estrang'd from love,<br />
From due allegiance to your prince and land,<br />
To leave your king when most he needs your help?<br />
The thrifty husbandmen are never wont,<br />
That see their lands unfruitful, to forsake them;<br />
But, when the mould is barren and unapt,<br />
They toil, they plow, and make the fallow fat:<br />
The pilot in the dangerous seas is known;<br />
In calmer waves the silly sailor strives.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>Are you not members, lords, of commonweal,<br />
And can your head, your dear anointed king,<br />
Default, ye lords, except yourselves do fail?<br />
O, stay your steps, return and counsel him!<br />
<br />
<i>Doug.</i> Men seek not moss upon a rolling stone,<br />
Or water from the sieve, or fire from ice,<br />
Or comfort from a reckless monarch's hands.<br />
Madam, he sets us light, that serv'd in court,<br />
In place of credit, in his father's days:<br />
If we but enter presence of his grace,<br />
Our payment is a frown, a scoff, a frump;<br />
Whilst flattering Gnatho<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> pranks it by his side,<br />
Soothing the careless king in his misdeeds:<br />
And, if your grace consider your estate,<br />
His life should urge you too, if all be true.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Why, Douglas, why?<br />
<br />
<i>Doug.</i> As if you have not heard<br />
His lawless love to Ida grown of late,<br />
His careless estimate of your estate.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, Douglas, thou misconster'st his intent!<br />
He doth but tempt his wife, he tries my love;<br />
This injury pertains to me, not to you.<br />
The king is young; and, if he step awry,<br />
He may amend, and I will love him still.<br />
Should we disdain our vines because they sprout<br />
Before their time? or young men, if they strain<br />
Beyond their reach? No; vines that bloom and spread<br />
Do promise fruits, and young men that are wild<br />
In age grow wise. My friends and Scottish peers,<br />
If that an English princess may prevail,<br />
Stay, stay with him: lo, how my zealous prayer<br />
Is plead with tears! fie, peers, will you hence?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span><i>Bp. of St And.</i> Madam, 'tis virtue in your grace to plead;<br />
But we, that see his vain untoward course,<br />
Cannot but fly the fire before it burn,<br />
And shun the court before we see his fall.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Will you not stay? then, lordings, fare you well.<br />
Though you forsake your king, the heavens, I hope,<br />
Will favour him through mine incessant prayer.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Content you, madam; thus old Ovid sings,<br />
'Tis foolish to bewail recureless things.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Peace, dwarf; these words my patience move.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Although you charm my speech, charm not my love.<br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Edinburgh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Slipper</span> <i>one way, and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Bartram</span>
<i>another way.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> Ho, fellow! stay, and let me
speak with thee.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Fellow! friend, thou dost disbuse
me; I am a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> A gentleman! how so?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, I rub horses, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> And what of that?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O simple-witted! mark my reason. They that
do good service in the commonweal are gentlemen; but
such as rub horses do good service in the commonweal;
ergo, tarbox, master courtier, a horse-keeper is a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> Here is overmuch wit, in good earnest.
But, sirrah, where is thy master?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Neither above ground nor under ground, drawing
out red into white, swallowing that down without
chawing that was never made without treading.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> Why, where is he, then?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, in his cellar, drinking a cup of neat and
brisk claret, in a bowl of silver. O, sir, the wine runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
trillill down his throat, which cost the poor vintner many
a stamp before it was made. But I must hence, sir, I
have haste.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> Why, whither now, I prithee?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Faith, sir, to Sir Silvester, a knight, hard by,
upon my master's errand, whom I must certify this, that
the lease of East Spring shall be confirmed; and therefore
must I bid him provide trash, for my master is no
friend without money.</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Bar.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. This is the thing for which I su'd so long,<br />
This is the lease which I, by Gnatho's means,<br />
Sought to possess by patent from the king;<br />
But he, injurious man, who lives by crafts,<br />
And sells king's favours for who will give most,<br />
Hath taken bribes of me, yet covertly<br />
Will sell away the thing pertains to me:<br />
But I have found a present help, I hope,<br />
For to prevent his purpose and deceit.&mdash;<br />
Stay, gentle friend.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> A good word; thou hast won me: this word is
like a warm caudle to a cold stomach.</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Sirrah, wilt thou, for money and reward,<br />
Convey me certain letters, out of hand,<br />
From out thy master's pocket?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Will I, sir? why, were it to rob my father, hang
my mother, or any such like trifles, I am at your commandment,
sir. What will you give me, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> A hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> I am your man: give me earnest. I am dead
at a pocket, sir; why, I am a lifter, master, by my
occupation.</p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> A lifter! what is that?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, sir, I can lift a pot as well as any man,
and pick a purse as soon as any thief in my country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Bar.</i> Why, fellow, hold; here is earnest, ten
pound to assure thee. [<i>Gives money</i>]. Go, despatch,
and bring it me to yonder tavern thou seest; and
assure thyself, thou shalt both have thy skin full of wine
and the rest of thy money.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> I will, sir.&mdash;Now room for a gentleman, my
masters! who gives me money for a fair new angel,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> a

<p><i>Pur.</i> I say thou art too presumptuous, and the officers
shall school thee.</p>

servants in this court.</p>

I will do my duty.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> I'll make garters of thy guts, thou villain, if thou

<p><i>Ateu.</i> No, sir; the letters-patents for East Spring.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Why, sir, you talk wonders to me, if you ask
that question.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Yea, sir, and will work wonders too with you,
unless you find them out: villain, search me them out,
and bring them me, or thou art but dead.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> A terrible word in the latter end of a sessions.
Master, were you in your right wits yesternight?</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Dost thou doubt it?</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Ay, and why not, sir? for the greatest clerks
are not the wisest, and a fool may dance in a hood, as
well as a wise man in a bare frock: besides, such as
give themselves to philautia,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> as you do, master, are so
choleric of complexion that that which they burn in fire
over night they seek for with fury the next morning.
Ah, I take care of your worship! this commonweal
should have a great loss of so good a member as you are.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Thou flatterest me.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Is it flattery in me, sir, to speak you fair? what
is it, then, in you to dally with the king?</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Are you prating, knave? I will teach you
better nurture! Is this the care you have of my wardrobe,
of my accounts, and matters of trust?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p><i>And.</i> Why, alas, sir, in times past your garments have
been so well inhabited as your tenants would give no
place to a moth to mangle them; but since you are
grown greater, and your garments more fine and gay, if
your garments are not fit for hospitality, blame your
pride and commend my cleanliness: as for your writings,
I am not for them, nor they for me.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Villain, go, fly, find them out: if thou losest
them, thou losest my credit.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Alas, sir, can I lose that you never had?</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Say you so? then hold, feel you that you never
felt. [<i>Beats him.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jaques</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jaq.</i> O monsieur, <i>ayez patience</i>: pardon your <i>pauvre
valet</i>: me be at your commandment.</p>

<p><i>Ateu.</i> Signior Jaques, well met; you shall command
me.&mdash;Sirrah, go cause my writings be proclaimed in the
market-place; promise a great reward to them that find
them; look where I supped and everywhere.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> I will, sir&mdash;[<i>aside</i>]. Now are two knaves well met,
and three well parted: if thou conceive mine enigma,
gentlemen,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> what shall I be, then? faith, a plain harp-shilling.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Sieur Jaques, this our happy meeting rids<br />
Your friends and me of care and grievous toil;<br />
For I, that look into deserts of men,<br />
And see among the soldiers in this court<br />
A noble forward mind, and judge thereof,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>Cannot but seek the means to raise them up<br />
Who merit credit in the commonweal.<br />
To this intent, friend Jaques, I have found<br />
A means to make you great, and well-esteem'd<br />
Both with the king and with the best in court:<br />
For I espy in you a valiant mind,<br />
Which makes me love, admire, and honour you.<br />
To this intent, if so your trust, and faith,<br />
Your secrecy be equal with your force,<br />
I will impart a service to thyself,<br />
Which if thou dost effect, the king, myself,<br />
And what or he, or I with him, can work,<br />
Shall be employ'd in what thou wilt desire.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jaq.</i> Me sweara by my ten bones, my signior, to be
loyal to your lordship's intents, affairs: yea, my
<i>monseigneur, que non ferai-je pour</i> your pleasure? By
my sworda, me be no <i>babillard</i>.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Then hoping on thy truth, I prithee see<br />
How kind Ateukin is to forward thee.<br />
Hold [<i>giving money</i>], take this earnest-penny of my love,<br />
And mark my words: the king, by me, requires<br />
No slender service, Jaques, at thy hands.&mdash;<br />
Thou must by privy practice make away<br />
The queen, fair Dorothea, as she sleeps,<br />
Or how thou wilt, so she be done to death:<br />
Thou shalt not want promotion here in court.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jaq.</i> Stabba the woman! <i>par ma foi, monseigneur</i>, me
thrusta my weapon into her belly, so me may be guard
<i>par le roi</i>. Me do your service: but me no be hanged
<i>pour</i> my labour?</p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Thou shalt have warrant, Jaques, from the king:<br />
None shall outface, gainsay, and wrong my friend.<br />
Do not I love thee, Jaques? fear not, then:<br />
I tell thee, whoso toucheth thee in aught<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>Shall injure me: I love, I tender thee:<br />
Thou art a subject fit to serve his grace.<br />
Jaques, I had a written warrant once,<br />
But that, by great misfortune, late is lost.<br />
Come, wend we to Saint Andrews, where his grace<br />
Is now in progress, where he shall assure<br />
Thy safety, and confirm thee to the act.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jaq.</i> We will attend your nobleness.

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>The Palace of the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Scots</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Queen Dorothea, Sir Bartram, Nano,
Ross</span>, Ladies, <i>and</i> Attendants.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Thy credit, Bartram, in the Scottish court,<br />
Thy reverend years, the strictness of thy vows,<br />
All these are means sufficient to persuade;<br />
But love, the faithful link of loyal hearts,<br />
That hath possession of my constant mind,<br />
Exiles all dread, subdueth vain suspect.<br />
Methinks no craft should harbour in that breast<br />
Where majesty and virtue are install'd:<br />
Methinks my beauty should not cause my death.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> How gladly, sovereign princess, would I err,<br />
And bide my shame to save your royal life!<br />
'Tis princely in yourself to think the best,<br />
To hope his grace is guiltless of this crime:<br />
But if in due prevention you default,<br />
How blind are you that were forewarn'd before!<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Suspicion without cause deserveth blame.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span><i>Sir Bar.</i> Who see, and shun not, harms, deserve the same.<br />
Behold the tenor of this traitorous plot.<br />
[<i>Gives warrant.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What should I read? Perhaps he wrote it not.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> Here is his warrant, under seal and sign,<br />
To Jaques, born in France, to murder you.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, careless king, would God this were not thine!<br />
What though I read? ah, should I think it true?<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> The hand and seal confirm the deed is his.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What know I though if now he thinketh this?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Madam, Lucretius saith that to repent<br />
Is childish, wisdom to prevent.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What tho?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Then cease your tears, that have dismay'd you,<br />
And cross the foe before he have betray'd you.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> What need these long suggestions in this cause,<br />
When every circumstance confirmeth truth?<br />
First, let the hidden mercy from above<br />
Confirm your grace, since by a wondrous means<br />
The practice of your dangers came to light:<br />
Next, let the tokens of approvèd truth<br />
Govern and stay your thoughts, too much seduc'd,<br />
And mark the sooth, and listen the intent.<br />
Your highness knows, and these my noble lords<br />
Can witness this, that whilst your husband's sire<br />
In happy peace possess'd the Scottish crown,<br />
I was his sworn attendant here in court;<br />
In dangerous fight I never fail'd my lord;<br />
And since his death, and this your husband's reign,<br />
No labour, duty, have I left undone,<br />
To testify my zeal unto the crown.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>But now my limbs are weak, mine eyes are dim,<br />
Mine age unwieldly and unmeet for toil,<br />
I came to court, in hope, for service past,<br />
To gain some lease to keep me, being old.<br />
There found I all was upsy-turvy turn'd,<br />
My friends displac'd, the nobles loth to crave:<br />
Then sought I to the minion of the king,<br />
Ateukin, who, allurèd by a bribe,<br />
Assur'd me of the lease for which I sought.<br />
But see the craft! when he had got the grant,<br />
He wrought to sell it to Sir Silvester,<br />
In hope of greater earnings from his hands.<br />
In brief, I learn'd his craft, and wrought the means,<br />
By one his needy servants for reward,<br />
To steal from out his pocket all the briefs;<br />
Which he perform'd, and with reward resign'd.<br />
Them when I read,&mdash;now mark the power of God,&mdash;<br />
I found this warrant seal'd among the rest,<br />
To kill your grace, whom God long keep alive!<br />
Thus, in effect, by wonder are you sav'd:<br />
Trifle not, then, but seek a speedy flight;<br />
God will conduct your steps, and shield the right.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What should I do? ah, poor unhappy queen,<br />
Born to endure what fortune can contain!<br />
Alas, the deed is too apparent now!<br />
But, O mine eyes, were you as bent to hide<br />
As my poor heart is forward to forgive,<br />
Ah cruel king, my love would thee acquit!<br />
O, what avails to be allied and match'd<br />
With high estates, that marry but in show?<br />
Were I baser born, my mean estate<br />
Could warrant me from this impendent harm:<br />
But to be great and happy, these are twain.<br />
Ah, Ross, what shall I do? how shall I work?<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> With speedy letters to your father send,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>Who will revenge you and defend your right.<br />
<br />
<i>Q.  Dor.</i> As if they kill not me, who with him fight!<br />
As if his breast be touch'd, I am not wounded!<br />
As if he wail'd, my joys were not confounded!<br />
We are one heart, though rent by hate in twain;<br />
One soul, one essence doth our weal contain:<br />
What, then, can conquer him, that kills not me?<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> If this advice displease, then, madam, flee.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Where may I wend or travel without fear?<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> Where not, in changing this attire you wear?<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What, shall I clad me like a country maid?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> The policy is base, I am afraid.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Why, Nano?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Ask you why? What, may a queen<br />
March forth in homely weed, and be not seen?<br />
The rose, although in thorny shrubs she spread,<br />
Is still the rose, her beauties wax not dead;<br />
And noble minds, although the coat be bare,<br />
Are by their semblance known, how great they are.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Bar.</i> The dwarf saith true.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What garments lik'st thou, than?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Such as may make you seem a proper man.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> He makes me blush and smile, though I am sad.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> The meanest coat for safety is not bad.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What, shall I jet<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> in breeches, like a squire?<br />
Alas, poor dwarf, thy mistress is unmeet.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Tut, go me thus, your cloak before your face,<br />
Your sword uprear'd with quaint and comely grace:<br />
If any come and question what you be,<br />
Say you "A man," and call for witness me.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What, should I wear a sword? to what intent?<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span><i>Nano.</i> Madam, for show; it is an ornament:<br />
If any wrong you, draw: a shining blade<br />
Withdraws a coward thief that would invade.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> But, if I strike, and he should strike again,<br />
What should I do? I fear I should be slain.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> No, take it single on your dagger so:<br />
I'll teach you, madam, how to ward a blow.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> How little shapes much substance may include!&mdash;<br />
Sir Bartram, Ross, ye ladies, and my friends,<br />
Since presence yields me death, and absence life,<br />
Hence will I fly, disguisèd like a squire,<br />
As one that seeks to live in Irish wars:<br />
You, gentle Ross, shall furnish my depart.<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> Yea, prince, and die with you with all my heart!<br />
Vouchsafe me, then, in all extremest states<br />
To wait on you and serve you with my best.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> To me pertains the woe: live then in rest.<br />
Friends, fare you well: keep secret my depart:<br />
Nano alone shall my attendant be.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Then, madam, are you mann'd, I warrant ye!<br />
Give me a sword, and, if there grow debate,<br />
I'll come behind, and break your enemy's pate.<br />
<br />
<i>Ross.</i> How sore we grieve to part so soon away!<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Grieve not for those that perish if they stay.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> The time in words misspent is little worth;<br />
Madam, walk on, and let them bring us forth.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

I know my portions merit none so fair,<br />
And yet I hold in farm and yearly rent<br />
A thousand pound, which may her state content.<br />

<p><i>Jaq. Mon dieu</i>, what <i>malheur</i> be this! me come a the
chamber, Signior Andrew, <i>mon dieu</i>; taka my poniard
<i>en ma main</i> to give the <i>estocade</i> to the <i>damoisella: par
ma foi</i>, there was no person; <i>elle s'est en allée</i>.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> The worse luck, Jaques: but because I am thy
friend, I will advise thee somewhat towards the attainment
of the gallows.</p>

<p><i>Jaq.</i> Gallows! what be that?</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Marry, sir, a place of great promotion, where
thou shalt by one turn above ground rid the world of a
knave, and make a goodly ensample for all bloody
villains of thy profession.</p>

<p><i>Jaq. Que dites vous</i>, Monsieur Andrew?</p>

<p><i>And.</i> I say, Jaques, thou must keep this path, and hie
thee; for the queen, as I am certified, is departed with
her dwarf, apparelled like a squire. Overtake her,
Frenchman, stab her: I'll promise thee, this doublet
shall be happy.</p>

<p><i>Jaq. Pourquoi?</i></p>

<p><i>And.</i> It shall serve a jolly gentleman, Sir Dominus
Monseigneur Hangman.</p>

This last night, our jolly horsekeeper, being well steeped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
in liquor, confessed to me the stealing of my master's
writings, and his great reward. Now dare I not bewray
him, lest he discover my knavery; but this have I
wrought: I understand he will pass this way, to provide
him necessaries; but, if I and my fellows fail not, we will
teach him such a lesson as shall cost him a chief place
on Pennyless Bench<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> for his labour. But yond he

<p><i>Tai.</i> Sir?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Let my doublet be white northern, five groats
the yard: I tell thee, I will be brave.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> It shall, sir.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Now, sir, cut it me like the battlements of a
custard, full of round holes; edge me the sleeves with
Coventry blue, and let the linings be of tenpenny lockram.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> Very good, sir.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Make it the amorous cut, a flap before.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> And why so? that fashion is stale.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> O, friend, thou art a simple fellow. I tell thee,
a flap is a great friend to a storrie; it stands him instead
of clean napery; and, if a man's shirt be torn, it is a
present penthouse to defend him from a clean huswife's
scoff.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> You say sooth, sir.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> [<i>giving money</i>]. Hold, take thy money; there is
seven shillings for the doublet, and eight for the breeches:
seven and eight; by'rlady, thirty-six is a fair deal of
money.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> Farewell, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Nay, but stay, tailor.</p>

<p><i>Tai.</i> Why, sir?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Forget not this special make: let my back-parts
be well lined, for there come many winter-storms from a
windy belly, I tell thee. [<i>Exit</i> Tailor]. Shoemaker.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Gentleman, what shoe will it please you to have?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> A fine, neat calves'-leather, my friend.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> O, sir, that is too thin, it will not last you.</p>

and Goodman Netherleather mine uncle; but my
mother, good woman, alas, she was a Spaniard, and
being well tanned and dressed by a good fellow, an
Englishman, is grown to some wealth: as, when I have
but my upper-parts clad in her husband's costly Spanish
leather, I may be bold to kiss the fairest lady's foot in
this country.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> You are of high birth, sir: but have you all
your mother's marks on you?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Why, knave?</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Because, if thou come of the blood of the
Slippers, you should have a shoemaker's awl thrust
through your ear.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> [<i>giving money</i>]. Take your earnest, friend, and
be packing, and meddle not with my progenitors.
[<i>Exit</i> Shoemaker]. Cutler.</p>

<p><i>Cut.</i> Here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> I must have a reaper and digger.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p><i>Cut.</i> A rapier and dagger, you mean, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Thou sayest true; but it must have a very fair
edge.</p>

<p><i>Cut.</i> Why so, sir?</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Because it may cut by himself, for truly, my friend,
I am a man of peace, and wear weapons but for fashion.</p>

<p><i>Cut.</i> Well, sir, give me earnest, I will fit you.</p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> [<i>giving money</i>]. Hold, take it: I betrust thee,
friend; let me be well armed.</p>

<p><i>Cut.</i> You shall. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Slip.</i> Now what remains? there's twenty crowns for
house, three crowns for household-stuff, sixpence to buy
a constable's staff; nay, I will be the chief of my parish.
There wants nothing but a wench, a cat, a dog, a wife,
and a servant, to make an whole family. Shall I marry
with Alice, Goodman Grimshawe's daughter? she is fair,
but indeed her tongue is like clocks on Shrove Tuesday,
always out of temper. Shall I wed Sisley of the
Whighton? O, no! she is like a frog in a parsley bed;
as skittish as an eel: if I seek to hamper her, she will
horn me. But a wench must be had, Master Slipper;
yea, and shall be, dear friend.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. I now will drive him from his contemplations.&mdash;O,
my mates, come forward: the lamb is
unpent, the fox shall prevail.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter three</i> Antics, <i>who dance round, and take</i>
Slipper <i>with them.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Slip.</i> I will, my friend, and I thank you heartily: pray,
keep your courtesy: I am yours in the way of an hornpipe.&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>].
They are strangers; I see they understand
not my language: wee, wee.&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>[<i>Whilst they are dancing</i>, <span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>takes away</i>
<span class="smcap">Slipper's</span> <i>money, and the other</i> Antics <i>depart.</i></p>

<p>Nay, but, my friends, one hornpipe further! a refluence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
back, and two doubles forward! What, not one cross-point
against Sundays? What, ho, sirrah, you gone?
you with the nose like an eagle, an you be a right Greek,
one turn more.&mdash;Thieves, thieves! I am robbed!
thieves! Is this the knavery of fiddlers? Well, I will
then bind the whole credit of their occupation on a bag-piper,
and he for my money. But I will after, and teach
them to caper in a halter, that have cozened me of my
money. [<i>Exit.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>The Forest near Edinburgh.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Queen Dorothea</span> <i>in man's apparel, and</i> <span class="smcap">Nano</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, Nano, I am weary of these weeds,<br />
Weary to wield this weapon that I bear,<br />
Weary of love from whom my woe proceeds,<br />
Weary of toil, since I have lost my dear.<br />
O weary life, where wanteth no distress,<br />
But every thought is paid with heaviness!<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Too much of weary, madam: if you please,<br />
Sit down, let weary die, and take your ease.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> How look I, Nano? like a man or no?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> If not a man, yet like a manly shrow.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> If any come and meet us on the way,<br />
What should we do, if they enforce us stay?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Set cap a-huff, and challenge him the field:<br />
Suppose the worst, the weak may fight to yield.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> The battle, Nano, in this troubled mind<br />
Is far more fierce than ever we may find.<br />
The body's wounds by medicines may be eas'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>But griefs of mind, by salves are no appeas'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Say, madam, will you hear your Nano sing?<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Of woe, good boy, but of no other thing.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> What if I sing of fancy?<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> will it please?<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> To such as hope success such notes breed ease.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> What if I sing, like Damon, to my sheep?<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Like Phillis, I will sit me down to weep.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Nay, since my songs afford such pleasure small,<br />
I'll sit me down, and sing you none at all.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> O, be not angry, Nano!<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Nay, you loathe<br />
To think on that which doth content us both.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> And how?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> You scorn disport when you are weary,<br />
And loathe my mirth, who live to make you merry.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Danger and fear withdraw me from delight.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> 'Tis virtue to contemn false fortune's spite.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What should I do to please thee, friendly squire?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> A smile a-day is all I will require;<br />
And, if you pay me well the smiles you owe me,<br />
I'll kill this cursèd care, or else beshrow me.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> We are descried; O, Nano, we are dead!<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>Nano.</i> Tut, yet you walk, you are not dead indeed.<br />
Draw me your sword, if he your way withstand,<br />
And I will seek for rescue out of hand.<br />
<br />

<p>
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Callet! me strumpet! Caitiff as thou art!<br />
But even a princess born, who scorns thy threats:<br />
Shall never Frenchman say an England maid<br />
Of threats of foreign force will be afraid.<br />
</p>

<h4>SCENE V.&mdash;<i>Another part of the Forest.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">King of Scots, Jaques, Ateukin, Andrew;
Jaques</span> <i>running with his sword one way, the</i> King
<i>with his</i> train <i>another way.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Stay, Jaques, fear not, sheath thy murdering blade:<br />
Lo, here thy king and friends are come abroad<br />
To save thee from the terrors of pursuit.<br />
What, is she dead?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jaq. Oui, Monsieur, elle</i> is <i>blessée par la tête</i> over <i>les
épaules</i>: I warrant, she no trouble you.</p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> O, then, my liege, how happy art thou grown,<br />
How favour'd of the heavens, and blest by love!<br />
Methinks I see fair Ida in thine arms,<br />
Craving remission for her late contempt;<br />
Methinks I see her blushing steal a kiss,<br />
Uniting both your souls by such a sweet;<br />
And you, my king, suck nectar from her lips.<br />
Why, then, delays your grace to gain the rest<br />
You long desir'd? why lose we forward time?<br />
Write, make me spokesman now, vow marriage:<br />
If she deny you favour, let me die.<br />
</p>

<p><i>And.</i> Mighty and magnificent potentate, give credence
to mine honourable good lord, for I heard the midwife
swear at his nativity that the fairies gave him the property
of the Thracian stone; for who toucheth it is exempted
from grief, and he that heareth my master's counsel is
already possessed of happiness; nay, which is more
miraculous, as the nobleman in his infancy lay in his
cradle, a swarm of bees laid honey on his lips in token
of his eloquence, for <i>melle dulcior fluit oratio</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Your grace must bear with imperfections:<br />
This is exceeding love that makes him speak.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Ateukin, I am ravish'd in conceit,<br />
And yet depress'd again with earnest thoughts.<br />
Methinks, this murder soundeth in mine ear<br />
A threatening noise of dire and sharp revenge:<br />
I am incens'd with grief, yet fain would joy.<br />
What may I do to end me of these doubts?<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Why, prince, it is no murder in a king<br />
To end another's life to save his own:<br />
For you are not as common people be,<br />
Who die and perish with a few men's tears;<br />
But if you fail, the state doth whole default,<br />
The realm is rent in twain in such a loss.<br />
And Aristotle holdeth this for true,<br />
Of evils needs we must choose the least:<br />
Then better were it, that a woman died<br />
Than all the help of Scotland should be blent.<br />
'Tis policy, my liege, in every state,<br />
To cut off members that disturb the head:<br />
And by corruption generation grows,<br />
And contraries maintain the world and state.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Enough, I am confirm'd. Ateukin, come,<br />
Rid me of love, and rid me of my grief;<br />
Drive thou the tyrant from this tainted breast,<br />
Then may I triumph in the height of joy.<br />
Go to mine Ida, tell her that I vow<br />
To raise her head, and make her honours great:<br />
Go to mine Ida, tell her that her hairs<br />
Shall be embellishèd with orient pearls,<br />
And crowns of sapphires compassing her brows,<br />
Shall war with those sweet beauties of her eyes:<br />
Go to mine Ida, tell her that my soul<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>Shall keep her semblance closèd in my breast;<br />
And I, in touching of her milk-white mould,<br />
Will think me deified in such a grace.<br />
I like no stay: go write, and I will sign:<br />
Reward me Jaques; give him store of crowns.<br />
And, Sirrah Andrew, scout thou here in court,<br />
And bring me tidings, if thou canst perceive<br />
The least intent of muttering in my train;<br />
For either those that wrong thy lord or thee<br />
Shall suffer death.<br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> How much, O mighty king,<br />
Is thy Ateukin bound to honour thee!&mdash;<br />
Bow thee, Andrew, bend thine sturdy knees;<br />
Seest thou not here thine only God on earth?<br />
[<i>Exit the</i> <span class="smcap">King</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq. Mais où est mon argent, seigneur?</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> Come, follow me. His grace, I see, is mad,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a><br />
That thus on sudden he hath left us here.&mdash;<br />
Come, Jaques: we will have our packet soon despatch'd,<br />
And you shall be my mate upon the way.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq. Comme vous plaira, monsieur.</i><br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Ateukin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jaques</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>And.</i> Was never such a world, I think, before,<br />
When sinners seem to dance within a net;<br />
The flatterer and the murderer, they grow big;<br />
By hook or crook promotion now is sought.<br />
In such a world, where men are so misled,<br />
What should I do, but, as the proverb saith,<br />
Run with the hare, and hunt with the hound?<br />
To have two means beseems a witty man.<br />
Now here in court I may aspire and climb<br />
By subtlety, for my master's death:<br />
And, if that fail, well fare another drift;<br />
I will, in secret, certain letters send<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>Unto the English king, and let him know<br />
The order of his daughter's overthrow,<br />
That, if my master crack his credit here,<br />
As I am sure long flattery cannot hold,<br />
I may have means within the English court<br />
To 'scape the scourge that waits on bad advice.<br />

If better motions yet than any past<br />

To save the queen his mistress, by his speed.<br />

Shall see, when least he hopes, I'll stand his friend,<br />
Or else he capers in a halter's end.<br />

I'll rather die than see him woebegone.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.<i>&mdash;Castle of</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Cuthbert Anderson</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Queen Dorothea</span> <i>in man's apparel and in a
nightgown,</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Anderson</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nano</span>; <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sir Cuthbert Anderson</span> <i>behind</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lady And.</i> My gentle friend, beware, in taking air,<br />
Your walks grow not offensive to your wounds.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Madam, I thank you of your courteous care:<br />
My wounds are well-nigh clos'd, though sore they are.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Methinks these closèd wounds should breed more grief,<br />
Since open wounds have cure, and find relief.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Madam, if undiscover'd wounds you mean,<br />
They are not cur'd, because they are not seen.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> I mean the wounds which do the heart subdue.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> O, that is love: Madam, speak I not true?<br />
[<span class="smcap">Sir Cuthbert Anderson</span> <i>overhears.</i><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span><i>Lady And.</i> Say it were true, what salve for such a sore?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Be wise, and shut such neighbours out of door.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> How if I cannot drive him from my breast?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Then chain him well, and let him do his best.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. In ripping up their wounds, I see their wit;<br />
But if these wounds be cur'd, I sorrow it.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Why are you so intentive to behold<br />
My pale and woful looks, by care controll'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Because in them a ready way is found<br />
To cure my care and heal my hidden wound.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Good master, shut your eyes, keep that conceit;<br />
Surgeons give coin to get a good receipt.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Peace, wanton son; this lady did amend<br />
My wounds; mine eyes her hidden griefs shall end.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Look not too much, it is a weighty case<br />
Whereas a man puts on a maiden's face;<br />
For many times, if ladies 'ware them not,<br />
A nine months' wound, with little work is got.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. I'll break off their dispute, lest love proceed<br />
From covert smiles, to perfect love indeed.<br />
[<i>Comes forward.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> The cat's abroad, stir not, the mice be still.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Tut, we can fly such cats, when so we will.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> How fares my guest? take cheer, naught shall default,<br />
That either doth concern your health or joy:<br />
Use me; my house, and what is mine is yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Thanks, gentle knight; and, if all hopes be true,<br />
I hope ere long to do as much for you.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span><i>Sir Cuth.</i> Your virtue doth acquit me of that doubt:<br />
But, courteous sir, since troubles call me hence,<br />
I must to Edinburgh unto the king,<br />
There to take charge, and wait him in his wars.&mdash;<br />
Meanwhile, good madam, take this squire in charge,<br />
And use him so as if it were myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Sir Cuthbert, doubt not of my diligence:<br />
Meanwhile, till your return, God send you health.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> God bless his grace, and, if his cause be just,<br />
Prosper his wars; if not, he'll mend, I trust.<br />
Good sir, what moves the king to fall to arms?<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> The King of England forageth his land,<br />
And hath besieg'd Dunbar with mighty force.<br />
What other news are common in the court.<br />
Read you these letters, madam;<br />
[<i>giving letters to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Anderson</span>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">tell the squire</span><br />
The whole affairs of state, for I must hence.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> God prosper you, and bring you back from thence!<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Cuthbert Anderson</span>.<br />
Madam, what news?<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> They say the queen is slain.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Tut, such reports more false than truth contain.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> But these reports have made his nobles leave him.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, careless men, and would they so deceive him?<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> The land is spoil'd, the commons fear the cross;<br />
All cry against the king, their cause of loss:<br />
The English king subdues and conquers all.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Alas, this war grows great on causes small!<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Our court is desolate, our prince alone,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>Still dreading death.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Woe's me, for him I mourn!<br />
Help, now help, a sudden qualm<br />
Assails my heart!<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Good madam, stand his friend:<br />
Give us some liquor to refresh his heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Daw thou him up,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and I will fetch thee forth<br />
Potions of comfort, to repress his pain. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Fie, princess, faint on every fond report!<br />
How well-nigh had you open'd your estate!<br />
Cover these sorrows with the veil of joy,<br />
And hope the best; for why this war will cause<br />
A great repentance in your husband's mind.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah, Nano, trees live not without their sap,<br />
And Clytie cannot blush but on the sun;<br />
The thirsty earth is broke with many a gap,<br />
And lands are lean where rivers do not run:<br />
Where soul is reft from that it loveth best,<br />
How can it thrive or boast of quiet rest?<br />
Thou know'st the prince's loss must be my death,<br />
His grief, my grief; his mischief must be mine.<br />
O, if thou love me, Nano, hie to court!<br />
Tell Ross, tell Bartram, that I am alive;<br />
Conceal thou yet the place of my abode:<br />
Will them, even as they love their queen,<br />
As they are chary of my soul and joy,<br />
To guard the king, to serve him as my lord.<br />
Haste thee, good Nano, for my husband's care<br />
Consumeth me, and wounds me to the heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Madam, I go, yet loth to leave you here.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Go thou with speed: even as thou hold'st me dear,<br />
Return in haste. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Nano</span>.<br />

<i>First Revel.</i> Fair Ida, sir, was married yesterday<br />
Unto Sir Eustace, and for that intent<br />
We feast and sport it thus to honour them:<br />
An, if you please, come in and take your part;<br />
My lady is no niggard of her cheer.<br />

<i>Jaq. Monseigneur</i>, why be you so sadda? <i>faites bonne chere: foutre de ce monde!</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ateu.</i> What, was I born to be the scorn of kin?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>To gather feathers like to a hopper-crow,<br />
And lose them in the height of all my pomp?<br />
Accursèd man, now is my credit lost!<br />
Where are my vows I made unto the king?<br />
What shall become of me, if he shall hear<br />
That I have caus'd him kill a virtuous queen,<br />
And hope in vain for that which now is lost?<br />
Where shall I hide my head? I know the heavens<br />
Are just and will revenge; I know my sins<br />
Exceed compare. Should I proceed in this,<br />
This Eustace must amain be made away.<br />
O, were I dead, how happy should I be!<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jaq. Est ce donc à tel point votre etat?</i> faith, then
adieu, Scotland, adieu, Signior Ateukin: me will homa
to France, and no be hanged in a strange country.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Ateu.</i> Thou dost me good to leave me thus alone,<br />
That galling grief and I may yoke in one.<br />
O, what are subtle means to climb on high,<br />
When every fall swarms with exceeding shame?<br />
I promis'd Ida's love unto the prince,<br />
But she is lost, and I am false forsworn.<br />
I practis'd Dorothea's hapless death,<br />
And by this practice have commenc'd a war.<br />
O cursèd race of men, that traffic guile,<br />
And, in the end, themselves and kings beguile!<br />
Asham'd to look upon my prince again,<br />
Asham'd of my suggestions and advice,<br />
Asham'd of life, asham'd that I have err'd,<br />
I'll hide myself, expecting for<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> my shame.<br />

By flattery, and make their prince their game. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

My daughter's death upon the traitorous Scot.<br />
And now before Dunbar our camp is pitch'd;<br />
Which, if it yield not to our compromise,<br />

Or I will put each mother's son to death,<br />
And lay this city level with the ground.<br />
<br />
<i>Doug.</i> For what offence, for what default of ours,<br />
Art thou incens'd so sore against our state?<br />
Can generous hearts in nature be so stern<br />
To prey on those that never did offend?<br />
What though the lion, king of brutish race,<br />

O English king, thou bearest in thy crest<br />
The king of beasts, that harms not yielding ones:<br />
The roseal cross is spread within thy field,<br />
A sign of peace, not of revenging war.<br />
Be gracious, then, unto this little town;<br />
And, though we have withstood thee for awhile<br />
To show allegiance to our liefest liege,<br />
Yet, since we know no hope of any help,<br />
Take us to mercy, for we yield ourselves.<br />

But, since I see thee wise and old in years,<br />
True to thy king, and faithful in his wars,<br />
Live thou and thine. Dunbar is too-too small<br />
To give an entrance to the English king:<br />
I, eagle-like, disdain these little fowls,<br />
And look on none but those that dare resist.<br />

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Near the Scottish Camp.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Lawyer, <i>a</i> Merchant, <i>and a</i> Divine.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Law.</i> My friends, what think you of this present state?<br />
Were ever seen such changes in a time?<br />
The manners and the fashions of this age<br />
Are, like the ermine-skin, so full of spots,<br />
As sooner may the Moor be washèd white<br />
Than these corruptions banish'd from this realm.<br />
<br />
<i>Merch.</i> What sees Mas Lawyer in this state amiss?<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> A wresting power that makes a nose of wax<br />
Of grounded law, a damn'd and subtle drift<br />
In all estates to climb by others' loss;<br />
An eager thirst of wealth, forgetting truth.<br />
Might I ascend unto the highest states,<br />
And by descent discover every crime,<br />
My friends, I should lament, and you would grieve<br />
To see the hapless ruins of this realm.<br />
<br />
<i>Div.</i> O lawyer, thou hast curious eyes to pry<br />
Into the secret maims of their estate;<br />
But if thy veil of error were unmask'd,<br />
Thyself should see your sect do maim her most.<br />
Are you not those that should maintain the peace,<br />
Yet only are the patrons of our strife?<br />
If your profession have his ground and spring<br />
First from the laws of God, then country's right,<br />
Not any ways inverting nature's power,<br />
Why thrive you by contentions? why devise you<br />
Clauses, and subtle reasons to except?<br />
Our state was first, before you grew so great,<br />
A lantern to the world for unity:<br />
Now they that are befriended and are rich<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>Oppress the poor: come Homer without coin,<br />
He is not heard. What shall we term this drift?<br />
To say the poor man's cause is good and just,<br />
And yet the rich man gains the best in law?<br />
It is your guise (the more the world laments)<br />
To coin provisos to beguile your laws;<br />
To make a gay pretext of due proceeding,<br />
When you delay your common-pleas for years.<br />
Mark what these dealings lately here have wrought:<br />
The crafty men have purchas'd great men's lands;<br />
They powl,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> they pinch, their tenants are undone;<br />
If these complain, by you they are undone;<br />
You fleece them of their coin, their children beg,<br />
And many want, because you may be rich:<br />
This scar is mighty, Master Lawyer.<br />
Now war hath gotten head within this land,<br />
Mark but the guise. The poor man that is wrong'd<br />
Is ready to rebel; he spoils, he pills;<br />
We need no foes to forage that we have:<br />
The law, say they, in peace consumèd us,<br />
And now in war we will consume the law.<br />
Look to this mischief, lawyers: conscience knows<br />
You live amiss; amend it, lest you end!<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> Good Lord, that these divines should see so far<br />
In others' faults, without amending theirs!<br />
Sir, sir, the general defaults in state<br />
(If you would read before you did correct)<br />
Are, by a hidden working from above,<br />
By their successive changes still remov'd.<br />
Were not the law by contraries maintain'd,<br />
How could the truth from falsehood be discern'd?<br />
Did we not taste the bitterness of war,<br />
How could we know the sweet effects of peace?<br />
Did we not feel the nipping winter-frosts,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>How should we know the sweetness of the spring?<br />
Should all things still remain in one estate,<br />
Should not in greatest arts some scars be found?<br />
Were all upright, nor chang'd, what world were this?<br />
A chaos, made of quiet, yet no world,<br />
Because the parts thereof did still accord:<br />
This matter craves a variance, not a speech.<br />
But, Sir Divine, to you: look on your maims,<br />
Divisions, sects, your simonies, and bribes,<br />
Your cloaking with the great for fear to fall,&mdash;<br />
You shall perceive you are the cause of all.<br />
Did each man know there was a storm at hand,<br />
Who would not clothe him well, to shun the wet?<br />
Did prince and peer, the lawyer and the least,<br />
Know what were sin, without a partial gloss,<br />
We'd need no long discovery then of crimes,<br />
For each would mend, advis'd by holy men.<br />
Thus [I] but slightly shadow out your sins;<br />
But, if they were depainted out of life,<br />
Alas, we both had wounds enough to heal!<br />
<br />
<i>Merch.</i> None of you both, I see, but are in fault;<br />
Thus simple men, as I, do swallow flies.<br />
This grave divine can tell us what to do;<br />
But we may say, "Physician, mend thyself."<br />
This lawyer hath a pregnant wit to talk;<br />
But all are words, I see no deeds of worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> Good merchant, lay your fingers on your mouth;<br />
Be not a blab, for fear you bite yourself.<br />
What should I term your state, but even the way<br />
To every ruin in this commonweal?<br />
You bring us in the means of all excess,<br />
You rate it and retail it as you please;<br />
You swear, forswear, and all to compass wealth;<br />
Your money is your god, your hoard your heaven;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>You are the groundwork of contention.<br />
First, heedless youth by you is over-reach'd;<br />
We are corrupted by your many crowns:<br />
The gentlemen, whose titles you have bought,<br />
Lose all their fathers' toil within a day,<br />
Whilst Hob your son, and Sib your nutbrown child,<br />
Are gentlefolks, and gentles are beguil'd.<br />
This makes so many noble minds to stray,<br />
And take sinister courses in the state.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Scout.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Scout.</i> My friends, be gone, an if you love your lives!<br />
The King of England marcheth here at hand:<br />
Enter the camp, for fear you be surpris'd.<br />

And place true zeal whereas corruption is! [<i>Exeunt</i>.<br />

<p>
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What news in court, Nano? let us know it.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> If so you please, my lord, I straight will show it:<br />
The English king hath all the borders spoil'd,<br />
Hath taken Morton prisoner, and hath slain<br />
Seven thousand Scottish lads not far from Tweed.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> A woful murder and a bloody deed!<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span><i>Nano.</i> The king, our liege, hath sought by many means<br />
For to appease his enemy by prayers:<br />
Naught will prevail unless he can restore<br />
Fair Dorothea, long supposèd dead:<br />
To this intent he hath proclaimèd late,<br />
That whosoe'er return the queen to court<br />
Shall have a thousand marks for his reward.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> He loves her, then, I see, although enforc'd,<br />
That would bestow such gifts for to regain her.<br />
Why sit you sad, good sir? be not dismay'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> I'll lay my life, this man would be a maid.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> [<i>aside to Nano</i>]. Fain would I show myself, and change my tire.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Whereon divine you, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Upon desire.<br />
Madam, mark but my skill. I'll lay my life,<br />
My master here, will prove a married wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> [<i>aside to Nano</i>]. Wilt thou bewray me, Nano?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> [<i>aside to Dor.</i>]. Madam, no:<br />
You are a man, and like a man you go:<br />
But I, that am in speculation seen,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a><br />
Know you would change your state to be a queen.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> [<i>aside to Nano</i>]. Thou art not, dwarf, to learn thy mistress' mind:<br />
Fain would I with thyself disclose my kind,<br />
But yet I blush.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> [<i>aside to Dor.</i>]. What? blush you, madam, than,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a><br />

<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Deceitful beauty, hast thou scorn'd me so?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Nay, muse not, madam, for he tells you true.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Beauty bred love, and love hath bred my shame.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span><i>Nano.</i> And women's faces work more wrongs than these:<br />
Take comfort, madam, to cure your disease.<br />
And yet he loves a man as well as you,<br />
Only this difference, he cannot fancy two.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Blush, grieve, and die in thine insatiate lust.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Nay, live, and joy that thou hast won a friend,<br />
That loves thee as his life by good desert.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> I joy, my lord, more than my tongue can tell:<br />
Though not as I desir'd, I love you well.<br />
But modesty, that never blush'd before,<br />
Discover my false heart: I say no more.<br />
Let me alone.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Good Nano, stay awhile.<br />
Were I not sad, how kindly could I smile,<br />
To see how fain I am to leave this weed!<br />
And yet I faint to show myself indeed:<br />
But danger hates delay; I will be bold.&mdash;<br />
Fair lady, I am not [as you] suppose,<br />
A man, but even that queen, more hapless I,<br />
Whom Scottish king appointed hath to die;<br />
I am the hapless princess, for whose right,<br />
These kings in bloody wars revenge despite;<br />
I am that Dorothea whom they seek,<br />
Yours bounden for your kindness and relief;<br />
And, since you are the means that save my life,<br />
Yourself and I will to the camp repair,<br />
Whereas your husband shall enjoy reward,<br />
And bring me to his highness once again.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> Pardon, most gracious princess, if you please,<br />
My rude discourse and homely entertain;<br />
And, if my words may savour any worth,<br />
Vouchsafe my counsel in this weighty cause:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>Since that our liege hath so unkindly dealt,<br />
Give him no trust, return unto your sire;<br />
There may you safely live in spite of him.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Ah lady, so would worldly counsel work;<br />
But constancy, obedience, and my love,<br />
In that my husband is my lord and chief,<br />
These call me to compassion of his state:<br />
Dissuade me not, for virtue will not change.<br />
<br />
<i>Lady And.</i> What wondrous constancy is this I hear!<br />
If English dames their husbands love so dear,<br />
I fear me in the world they have no peer.<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Come, princess, wend, and let us change your weed:<br />
I long to see you now a queen indeed. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

I am resolv'd to grant thee thy request.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> I see you trust me, princes, who repose<br />
The weight of such a war upon my will.<br />
Now mark my suit. A tender lion's whelp,<br />
This other day, came straggling in the woods,<br />
Attended by a young and tender hind,<br />
In courage haught, yet 'tirèd like a lamb.<br />
The prince of beasts had left this young in keep,<br />
To foster up as love-mate and compeer,<br />
Unto the lion's mate, a neighbour-friend:<br />
This stately guide, seducèd by the fox,<br />
Sent forth an eager wolf, bred up in France,<br />
That gripp'd the tender whelp and wounded it.<br />
By chance, as I was hunting in the woods,<br />
I heard the moan the hind made for the whelp:<br />
I took them both, and brought them to my house.<br />
With chary care I have recur'd the one;<br />
And since I know the lions are at strife<br />
About the loss and damage of the young,<br />
I bring her home; make claim to her who list.<br />

This royal English king, my happy sire:<br />
Poor Nano is the hind that tended me.<br />
My father, Scottish king, gave me to thee,<br />
A hapless wife: thou, quite misled by youth,<br />
Hast sought sinister loves and foreign joys.<br />
The fox Ateukin, cursèd parasite,<br />
Incens'd your grace to send the wolf abroad,<br />
The French-born Jaques, for to end my days:<br />
He, traitorous man, pursu'd me in the woods,<br />
And left me wounded; where this noble knight<br />
Both rescu'd me and mine, and sav'd my life.<br />

<br />
<i>Sir Cuth.</i> But you, my prince, must yield me mickle more.<br />
You know your nobles are your chiefest stays,<br />
And long time have been banish'd from your court:<br />
Embrace and reconcile them to yourself;<br />
They are your hands, whereby you ought to work.<br />
As for Ateukin and his lewd compeers,<br />
That sooth'd you in your sins and youthly pomp,<br />
Exile, torment, and punish such as they;<br />
For greater vipers never may be found<br />
Within a state than such aspiring heads,<br />
That reck not how they climb, so that they climb.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Guid knight, I grant thy suit.&mdash;First I submit,<br />
And humbly crave a pardon of your grace:&mdash;<br />
Next, courteous queen, I pray thee by thy loves<br />
Forgive mine errors past, and pardon me.&mdash;<br />
My lords and princes, if I have misdone<br />
(As I have wrong'd indeed both you and yours),<br />
Hereafter, trust me, you are dear to me.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>As for Ateukin, whoso finds the man,<br />
Let him have martial law, and straight be hang'd,<br />
As all his vain abettors now are dead.<br />
And Anderson our treasurer shall pay<br />
Three thousand marks for friendly recompense.<br />
<br />

Methinks of friendship Nano shall have none.<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> What would my dwarf, that I will not bestow?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> My boon, fair queen, is this,&mdash;that you would go:<br />
Although my body is but small and neat,<br />
My stomach, after toil, requireth meat:<br />
An easy suit, dread princess; will you wend?<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Art thou a pigmy-born, my pretty friend?<br />
<br />
<i>Nano.</i> Not so, great king, but Nature, when she fram'd me,<br />
Was scant of earth, and Nano therefore nam'd me;<br />
And, when she saw my body was so small,<br />
She gave me wit to make it big withal.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> Till time when&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Q. Dor.</i> Eat, then.<br />
<br />
<i>K. of Scots.</i> My friend, it stands with wit<br />
To take repast when stomach serveth it.<br />

Come, royal father, enter we my tent:&mdash;<br />
And, soldiers, feast it, frolic it, like friends:&mdash;<br />
My princes, bid this kind and courteous train<br />
Partake some favours of our late accord.<br />
Thus wars have end, and, after dreadful hate,<br />
Men learn at last to know their good estate.<br />

<h2><a name="GEORGE-A-GREENE" id="GEORGE-A-GREENE">GEORGE-A-GREENE,
THE PINNER OF
WAKEFIELD</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>


<p>The first Quarto of <i>George-a-Greene</i> was printed in 1599 by Simon
Stafford for Cuthbert Burby. It had been entered by Burby on the
Stationers' Registers four years earlier, 1st April 1595, as an interlude.
Henslowe's first notice of the play occurs for 29th December
1593, at which date it was performed by Sussex' men at the Rose,
these players possibly having secured the play from the Queen's
players. Henslowe records five performances between 29th
December 1593 and 22nd January 1594, sometimes under the
major title, and sometimes under the title <i>The Pinner of Wakefield</i>.
The play was reprinted in Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i> in 1744. Neither
on the title-page, nor on the Stationers' Registers, nor by Henslowe,
is the name of the author mentioned. For long it was supposed
that the play was by John Heywood. It was finally assigned to
Greene through the discovery by Collier of a copy of the Quarto of
1599 with the following notes on the title-page:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Written by ... a minister who act[ed] th[e] pinners pt in it
himselfe. Teste W. Shakespea[re].<br />
Ed. Juby saith that ye play was made by Ro. Gree[ne]."</p></blockquote>

<p>These notes are in different hands, and as against the adverse
testimony of internal structure, their evidence in favour of Greene's
authorship is of slight weight. With the exception of the episode of
the King of Scotland and Jane a' Barley the play is founded on a
romance, <i>The Famous History of George-a-Greene</i>, etc., first printed in
1706 by an editor, N. W., from a MS. now in Sion College. Whether
there was a printed Elizabethan version, or the author of the play
used the MS., it is now impossible to say. The romance is now
reprinted in Thoms' <i>Early English Prose Romances</i>, Vol. II. In
the Bodleian Library there is a black-letter romance of 1632, treating
the same subject, but its story is evidently not the basis of the
play. The Quarto of the play, which is owned by the Duke of
Devonshire, is very poorly printed, and many scenes have been
curtailed.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIRST</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>At Bradford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Kendal</span>; <i>with him</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Bonfield,
Sir Gilbert Armstrong, Sir Nicholas Mannering</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ken.</i> Welcome to Bradford, martial gentlemen,<br />
Lord Bonfield, and Sir Gilbert Armstrong both;<br />
And all my troops, even to my basest groom,<br />
Courage and welcome! for the day is ours.<br />
Our cause is good, 'tis for the land's avail:<br />
Then let us fight, and die for England's good.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span><i>All.</i> We will, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> As I am Henry Momford, Kendal's earl,<br />
You honour me with this assent of yours;<br />
And here upon my sword I make protest<br />
For to relieve the poor or die myself.<br />
And know, my lords, that James, the King of Scots,<br />
Wars hard upon the borders of this land:<br />
Here is his post.&mdash;Say, John Taylor, what news with King James?<br />
</p>

<p><i>John.</i> War, my lord, [I] tell, and good news, I trow;
for King Jamy vows to meet you the twenty-sixth of this
month, God willing; marry, doth he, sir.</p>

<p>
<i>Ken.</i> My friends, you see what we have to win.&mdash;<br />
Well, John, commend me to King James, and tell him,<br />
I will meet him the twenty-sixth of this month,<br />
And all the rest; and so, farewell. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
Bonfield, why stand'st thou as a man in dumps?<br />
Courage! for, if I win, I'll make thee duke:<br />
I, Henry Momford will be king myself;<br />
And I will make thee Duke of Lancaster,<br />
And Gilbert Armstrong Lord of Doncaster.<br />
<br />
<i>Bon.</i> Nothing, my lord, makes me amaz'd at all,<br />
But that our soldiers find our victuals scant.<br />
We must make havoc of those country-swains;<br />
For so will the rest tremble and be afraid,<br />
And humbly send provision to your camp.<br />
<br />
<i>Arm.</i> My Lord Bonfield gives good advice:<br />
They make a scorn, and stand upon the king;<br />
So what is brought is sent from them perforce;<br />
Ask Mannering else.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> What say'st thou, Mannering?<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Whenas I show'd your high commission,<br />
They made this answer,<br />
Only to send provision for your horses.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Well, hie thee to Wakefield, bid the town<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>To send me all provision that I want,<br />
Lest I, like martial Tamburlaine, lay waste<br />
Their bordering countries, and leaving none alive<br />
That contradicts my commission.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Let me alone;<br />
My lord, I'll make them vail<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> their plumes;<br />
For whatsoe'er he be, the proudest knight,<br />
Justice, or other, that gainsay'th your word,<br />
I'll clap him fast, to make the rest to fear.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Do so, Nick: hie thee thither presently,<br />
And let us hear of thee again to-morrow.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Will you not remove, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> No, I will lie at Bradford all this night<br />
And all the next.&mdash;Come, Bonfield, let us go,<br />
And listen out some bonny lasses here. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>At Wakefield.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Justice, Townsmen, <span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sir Nicholas Mannering</span> <i>with his commission.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Jus.</i> Master Mannering, stand aside, whilst we confer<br />
What is best to do.&mdash;Townsmen of Wakefield,<br />
The Earl of Kendal here hath sent for victuals;<br />
And in aiding him we show ourselves no less<br />
Than traitors to the king; therefore<br />
Let me hear, townsmen, what is your consents.<br />
<br />
<i>First Towns.</i> Even as you please, we are all content.<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Then, Master Mannering, we are resolv'd&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span><i>Man.</i> As how?<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Marry, sir, thus.<br />
We will send the Earl of Kendal no victuals,<br />
Because he is a traitor to the king;<br />
And in aiding him we show ourselves no less.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Why, men of Wakefield, are you waxen mad,<br />
That present danger cannot whet your wits,<br />
Wisely to make provision of yourselves?<br />
The earl is thirty thousand men strong in power,<br />
And what town soever him resist,<br />
He lays it flat and level with the ground.<br />
Ye silly men, you seek your own decay:<br />
Therefore send my lord such provision as he wants,<br />
So he will spare your town,<br />
And come no nearer Wakefield than he is.<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Master Mannering, you have your answer; you may be gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Well, Woodroffe, for so I guess is thy name,<br />
I'll make thee curse thy overthwart denial;<br />
And all that sit upon the bench this day shall rue<br />
The hour they have withstood my lord's commission.<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Do thy worst, we fear thee not.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> See you these seals? before you pass the town,<br />
I will have all things my lord doth want,<br />
In spite of you.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Proud dapper Jack, vail bonnet to the bench<br />
That represents the person of the king;<br />
Or, sirrah, I'll lay thy head before thy feet.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Why, who art thou?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Why, I am George-a-Greene,<br />
True liege-man to my king,<br />
Who scorns that men of such esteem as these<br />
Should brook the braves of any traitorous squire.<br />
You of the bench, and you, my fellow-friends,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>Neighbours, we subjects all unto the king;<br />
We are English born, and therefore Edward's friends.<br />
Vow'd unto him even in our mothers' womb,<br />
Our minds to God, our hearts unto our king:<br />
Our wealth, our homage, and our carcases,<br />
Be all King Edward's. Then, sirrah, we<br />
Have nothing left for traitors, but our swords,<br />
Whetted to bathe them in your bloods, and die<br />
'Gainst you, before we send you any victuals.<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Well spoken, George-a-Greene!<br />
<br />
<i>First Towns.</i> Pray let George-a-Greene speak for us.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Sirrah, you get no victuals here,<br />
Not if a hoof of beef would save your lives.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Fellow, I stand amaz'd at thy presumption.<br />
Why, what art thou that dar'st gainsay my lord,<br />
Knowing his mighty puissance and his stroke?<br />
Why, my friend, I come not barely of myself;<br />
For, see, I have a large commission.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Let me see it, sirrah [<i>Takes the commission</i>].<br />
Whose seals be these?<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> This is the Earl of Kendal's seal-at-arms;<br />
This Lord Charnel Bonfield's;<br />
And this Sir Gilbert Armstrong's.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> I tell thee, sirrah, did good King Edward's son<br />
Seal a commission 'gainst the king his father,<br />
Thus would I tear it in despite of him,<br />
[<i>Tears the commission.</i><br />
Being traitor to my sovereign.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> What, hast thou torn my lord's commission?<br />
Thou shalt rue it, and so shall all Wakefield.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> What, are you in choler? I will give you pills<br />
To cool your stomach. Seest thou these seals?<br />
Now, by my father's soul,<br />
Which was a yeoman when he was alive,<br />
Eat them, or eat my dagger's point, proud squire.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span><i>Man.</i> But thou dost but jest, I hope.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Sure that shall you see before we two part.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Well, an there be no remedy, so, George:<br />
[<i>Swallows one of the seals.</i><br />
One is gone; I pray thee, no more now.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> O, sir, if one be good, the others cannot hurt.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Mannering</span> <i>swallows the other two seals.</i><br />
So, sir; now you may go tell the Earl of Kendal,<br />
Although I have rent his large commission,<br />
Yet of courtesy I have sent all his seals<br />
Back again by you.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Well, sir, I will do your errand. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Now let him tell his lord that he hath spoke<br />
With George-a-Greene,<br />
Hight Pinner of merry Wakefield town,<br />
That hath physic for a fool,<br />
Pills for a traitor that doth wrong his sovereign.<br />
Are you content with this that I have done?<br />
<br />
<i>Jus.</i> Ay, content, George;<br />
For highly hast thou honour'd Wakefield town<br />
In cutting off proud Mannering so short.<br />
Come, thou shalt be my welcome guest to-day;<br />
For well thou hast deserv'd reward and favour.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>In Westmoreland.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Musgrove</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cuddy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cud.</i> Now, gentle father, list unto thy son,<br />
And for my mother's love,<br />
That erst was blithe and bonny in thine eye,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>Grant one petition that I shall demand.<br />
<br />
<i>Mus.</i> What is that, my Cuddy?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> Father, you know the ancient enmity of late<br />
Between the Musgroves and the wily Scots,<br />
Whereof they have oath<br />
Not to leave one alive that strides a lance.<br />
O father, you are old, and, waning, age unto the grave:<br />
Old William Musgrove, which whilom was thought<br />
The bravest horseman in all Westmoreland,<br />
Is weak, and forc'd to stay his arm upon a staff,<br />
That erst could wield a lance.<br />
Then, gentle father, resign the hold to me;<br />
Give arms to youth, and honour unto age.<br />
<br />
<i>Mus.</i> Avaunt, false-hearted boy! my joints do quake<br />
Even with anguish of thy very words.<br />
Hath William Musgrove seen an hundred years?<br />
Have I been fear'd and dreaded of the Scots,<br />
That, when they heard my name in any road,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a><br />
They fled away, and posted thence amain,<br />
And shall I die with shame now in mine age?<br />
No, Cuddy, no: thus resolve I,<br />
Here have I liv'd, and here will Musgrove die.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>At Bradford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Bonfield, Sir Gilbert Armstrong,
Grime</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bettris</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span><i>Bon.</i> Now, gentle Grime, God-a-mercy for our good cheer;<br />
Our fare was royal, and our welcome great:<br />
And sith so kindly thou hast entertain'd us,<br />
If we return with happy victory,<br />
We will deal as friendly with thee in recompense.<br />
<br />
<i>Grime.</i> Your welcome was but duty, gentle lord;<br />
For wherefore have we given us our wealth,<br />
But to make our betters welcome when they come?<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. O, this goes hard when traitors must be flatter'd!<br />
But life is sweet, and I cannot withstand it:<br />
God, I hope, will revenge the quarrel of my king.<br />
<br />
<i>Arm.</i> What said you, Grime?<br />
<br />
<i>Grime.</i> I say, Sir Gilbert, looking on my daughter,<br />
I curse the hour that e'er I got the girl;<br />
For, sir, she may have many wealthy suitors,<br />
And yet she disdains them all,<br />
To have poor George-a-Greene unto her husband.<br />
<br />
<i>Bon.</i> On that, good Grime, I am talking with thy daughter;<br />
But she, in quirks and quiddities of love,<br />
Sets me to school, she is so over-wise.&mdash;<br />
But, gentle girl, if thou wilt forsake the Pinner<br />
And be my love, I will advance thee high;<br />
To dignify those hairs of amber hue,<br />
I'll grace them with a chaplet made of pearl,<br />
Set with choice rubies, sparks, and diamonds,<br />
Planted upon a velvet hood, to hide that head<br />
Wherein two sapphires burn like sparkling fire:<br />
This will I do, fair Bettris, and far more,<br />
If thou wilt love the Lord of Doncaster.<br />

Perhaps on the earl, if that be he.<br />
See where he comes, or angry, or in love,<br />

<br />
<i>Bon.</i> How now, my lord! what news?<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Such news, Bonfield, as will make thee laugh,<br />
And fret thy fill, to hear how Nick was us'd.<br />
Why, the Justices stand on their terms:<br />
Nick, as you know, is haughty in his words;<br />
He laid the law unto the Justices<br />
With threatening braves, that one look'd on another,<br />
Ready to stoop; but that a churl came in,<br />
One George-a-Greene, the Pinner of the town,<br />
And with his dagger drawn laid hands on Nick,<br />
And by no beggars swore that we were traitors,<br />
Rent our commission, and upon a brave<br />
Made Nick to eat the seals or brook the stab:<br />
Poor Mannering, afraid, came posting hither straight.<br />

Thou know'st, that yesternight I courted thee,<br />
And swore at my return to wed with thee.<br />
Then tell me, love, shall I have all thy fair?<br />

Nor baron that is so bold;<br />
For George-a-Greene, the merry Pinner,<br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Before</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John-a-Barley's</span>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">James, King of Scots, Lord Humes</span>, <i>with</i>
Soldiers, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. James.</i> Why, Johnny, then the Earl of Kendal is blithe,<br />
And hath brave men that troop along with him?<br />
<br />
<i>John.</i> Ay, marry, my liege,<br />
And hath good men that come along with him,<br />
And vows to meet you at Scrasblesea, God willing.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> If good Saint Andrew lend King Jamy leave,<br />
I will be with him at the 'pointed day.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ned</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
But, soft!&mdash;Whose pretty boy art thou?<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> Sir, I am son unto Sir John-a-Barley,<br />
Eldest, and all that e'er my mother had;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>Edward my name.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> And whither art thou going, pretty Ned?<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> To seek some birds, and kill them, if I can:<br />
And now my schoolmaster is also gone,<br />
So have I liberty to ply my bow;<br />
For when he comes, I stir not from my book.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Lord Humes, but mark the visage of this child:<br />
By him I guess the beauty of his mother;<br />
None but Leda could breed Helena.&mdash;<br />
Tell me, Ned, who is within with thy mother?<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> Naught but herself and household servants, sir:<br />
If you would speak with her, knock at this gate.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Johnny, knock at that gate.<br />
[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>knocks at the gate.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jane-a-Barley</span> <i>upon the walls.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Jane.</i> O, I'm betray'd! What multitudes be these?<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Fear not, fair Jane, for all these men are mine,<br />
And all thy friends, if thou be friend to me:<br />
I am thy lover, James the King of Scots,<br />
That oft have su'd and woo'd with many letters,<br />
Painting my outward passions with my pen,<br />
Whenas my inward soul did bleed for woe.<br />
Little regard was given to my suit;<br />
But haply thy husband's presence wrought it:<br />
Therefore, sweet Jane, I fitted me to time,<br />
And, hearing that thy husband was from home,<br />
Am come to crave what long I have desir'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> Nay, soft you, sir! you get no entrance here,<br />
That seek to wrong Sir John-a-Barley so,<br />
And offer such dishonour to my mother.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Why, what dishonour, Ned?<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> Though young,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>Yet often have I heard my father say,<br />
No greater wrong than to be made cuckold.<br />
Were I of age, or were my body strong,<br />
Were he ten kings, I would shoot him to the heart<br />
That should attempt to give Sir John the horn.&mdash;<br />
Mother, let him not come in:<br />
I will go lie at Jocky Miller's house.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Stay him.<br />
<br />
<i>Jane.</i> Ay, well said; Ned, thou hast given the king his answer;<br />
For were the ghost of Cæsar on the earth,<br />
Wrapp'd in the wonted glory of his honour,<br />
He should not make me wrong my husband so.<br />
But good King James is pleasant, as I guess,<br />
And means to try what humour I am in;<br />
Else would he never have brought an host of men,<br />
To have them witness of his Scottish lust.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Jane, in faith, Jane,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Jane.</i> Never reply,<br />
For I protest by the highest holy God,<br />
That doometh just revenge for things amiss,<br />
King James, of all men, shall not have my love.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Then list to me: Saint Andrew be my boot,<br />
But I'll raze thy castle to the very ground,<br />
Unless thou open the gate, and let me in.<br />
<br />
<i>Jane.</i> I fear thee not, King Jamy: do thy worst.<br />
This castle is too strong for thee to scale;<br />
Besides, to-morrow will Sir John come home.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Well, Jane, since thou disdain'st King James's love,<br />
I'll draw thee on with sharp and deep extremes;<br />
For, by my father's soul, this brat of thine<br />
Shall perish here before thine eyes,<br />
Unless thou open the gate, and let me in.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span><i>Jane.</i> O deep extremes! my heart begins to break:<br />
My little Ned looks pale for fear.&mdash;<br />
Cheer thee, my boy, I will do much for thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> But not so much as to dishonour me.<br />
<br />
<i>Jane.</i> An if thou diest, I cannot live, sweet Ned.<br />
<br />
<i>Ned.</i> Then die with honour, mother, dying chaste.<br />
<br />
<i>Jane.</i> I am armed:<br />
My husband's love, his honour, and his fame,<br />
Join<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> victory by virtue. Now, King James,<br />
If mother's tears cannot allay thine ire,<br />
Then butcher him, for I will never yield:<br />
The son shall die before I wrong the father.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Why, then, he dies.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Alarum within. Enter a</i> Messenger.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Mess.</i> My lord, Musgrove is at hand.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Who, Musgrove? The devil he is! Come, my horse!<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<br />

</p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>At Wakefield.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Geo.</i> The sweet content of men that live in love<br />
Breeds fretting humours in a restless mind;<br />
And fancy, being check'd by fortune's spite,<br />
Grows too impatient in her sweet desires;<br />
Sweet to those men whom love leads on to bliss,<br />
But sour to me whose hap is still amiss.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jenkin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Marry, amen, sir.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Sir, what do you cry "amen" at?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Why, did not you talk of love?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> How do you know that?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, though I say it that should not say it, there
are few fellows in our parish so nettled with love as I
have been of late.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Sirrah, I thought no less, when the other morning
you rose so early to go to your wenches. Sir, I had
thought you had gone about my honest business.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Trow, you have hit it; for, master, be it known
to you, there is some good-will betwixt Madge the souce-wife<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
and I; marry, she hath another lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Can'st thou brook any rivals in thy love?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> A rider! no, he is a sow-gelder and goes afoot.
But Madge 'pointed to meet me in your wheat-close.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Well, did she meet you there?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Never make question of that. And first I saluted
her with a green gown, and after fell as hard a-wooing as
if the priest had been at our backs to have married us.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> What, did she grant?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Did she grant! never make question of that.
And she gave me a shirt-collar wrought over with no
counterfeit stuff.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> What, was it gold?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Nay, 'twas better than gold.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> What was it?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Right Coventry blue. We had no sooner come
there but wot you who came by?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> No: who?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Clim the sow-gelder.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Came he by?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> He spied Madge and I sit together: he leapt
from his horse, laid his hand on his dagger, and began
to swear. Now I seeing he had a dagger, and I nothing
but this twig in my hand, I gave him fair words and said
nothing. He comes to me, and takes me by the bosom.
"You whoreson slave," said he, "hold my horse, and
look he take no cold in his feet." "No, marry, shall
he, sir," quoth I; "I'll lay my cloak underneath him."
I took my cloak, spread it all along, and his horse on
the midst of it.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Thou clown, didst thou set his horse upon thy
cloak?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Ay, but mark how I served him. Madge and he
was no sooner gone down into the ditch, but I plucked
out my knife, cut four holes in my cloak, and made his
horse stand on the bare ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> 'Twas well done. Now, sir, go and survey my
fields: if you find any cattle in the corn, to pound with
them.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And if I find any in the pound, I shall turn them
out. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Kendal, Lord Bonfield, Sir
Gilbert Armstrong</span>, <i>all disguised, with a train
of men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ken.</i> Now we have put the horses in the corn,<br />
Let us stand in some corner for to hear<br />
What braving terms the Pinner will breathe<br />
When he spies our horses in the corn.<br />
[<i>Retires with the others.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jenkin</span> <i>blowing his horn.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jen.</i> O master, where are you? we have a prize.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> A prize! what is it?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Three goodly horses in our wheat-close.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Three horses in our wheat-close! whose be they?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Marry, that's a riddle to me; but they are there;
velvet<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> horses, and I never saw such horses before. As
my duty was, I put off my cap, and said as followeth:
"My masters, what do you make in our close?" One
of them, hearing me ask what he made there, held up
his head and neighed, and after his manner laughed as
heartily as if a mare had been tied to his girdle. "My
masters," said I, "it is no laughing matter; for, if my
master take you here, you go as round as a top to the
pound." Another untoward jade, hearing me threaten
him to the pound and to tell you of them, cast up both
his heels, and let such a monstrous great fart, that
was as much as in his language to say, "A fart for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
the pound, and a fart for George-a-Greene!" Now I,
hearing this, put on my cap, blew my horn, called them
all jades, and came to tell you.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Now, sir, go and drive me those three horses to
the pound.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Do you hear? I were best to take a constable
with me.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Why, they, being gentlemen's horses, may stand
on their reputation, and will not obey me.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Go, do as I bid you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, I may go.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Kendal, Lord Bonfield</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert Armstrong</span> <i>come forward.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ken.</i> Whither away, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Jen.</i> Whither away! I am going to put the horses in the pound.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Sirrah, those three horses belong to us,<br />
And we put them in,<br />
And they must tarry there and eat their fill.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Stay, I will go tell my master.&mdash;Hear you,
master? we have another prize: those three horses be
in your wheat-close still, and here be three geldings more.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> What be these?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> These are the masters of the horses.</p>

<p>
<i>Geo.</i> Now, gentlemen (I know not your degrees,<br />
But more you cannot be, unless you be kings,)<br />
Why wrong you us of Wakefield with your horses?<br />
I am the Pinner, and, before you pass,<br />
You shall make good the trespass they have done.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Peace, saucy mate, prate not to us:<br />
I tell thee, Pinner, we are gentlemen.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Why, sir, so may I, sir, although I give no arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ken.</i> Thou! how art thou a gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And such is my master, and he may give as good
arms as ever your great-grandfather could give.</p>

<p><i>Ken.</i> Pray thee, let me hear how.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Marry, my master may give for his arms the
picture of April in a green jerkin, with a rook on one
fist and an horn on the other: but my master gives
his arms the wrong way, for he gives the horn on
his fist; and your grandfather, because he would not
lose his arms, wears the horn on his own head.</p>

<p>
<i>Ken.</i> Well, Pinner, sith our horses be in,<br />
In spite of thee they now shall feed their fill,<br />
And eat until our leisures serve to go.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Now, by my father's soul,<br />
Were good King Edward's horses in the corn,<br />
They shall amend the scath, or kiss the pound;<br />
Much more yours, sir, whatsoe'er you be.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Why, man, thou knowest not us:<br />
We do belong to Henry Momford, Earl of Kendal;<br />
Men that, before a month be full expir'd,<br />
Will be King Edward's betters in the land.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> King Edward's betters! Rebel, thou liest!<br />
[<i>Strikes him.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Bon.</i> Villain, what hast thou done? thou hast struck an earl.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Why, what care I? a poor man that is true,<br />
Is better than an earl, if he be false.<br />
Traitors reap no better favours at my hands.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Ay, so methinks; but thou shalt dear aby<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> this blow.&mdash;<br />
Now or never lay hold on the Pinner!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>All the train comes forward.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span><i>Geo.</i> Stay, my lords, let us parley on these broils:<br />
Not Hercules against two, the proverb is,<br />
Nor I against so great a multitude.&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside</i>]. Had not your troops come marching as they did,<br />
I would have stopt your passage unto London:<br />
But now I'll fly to secret policy.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> What dost thou murmur, George?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Marry, this, my lord; I muse,<br />
If thou be Henry Momford, Kendal's earl,<br />
That thou wilt do poor George-a-Greene this wrong,<br />
Ever to match me with a troop of men.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken</i> Why dost thou strike me, then?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Why, my lord, measure me but by yourself:<br />
Had you a man had serv'd you long,<br />
And heard your foe misuse you behind your back,<br />
And would not draw his sword in your defence,<br />
You would cashier him.<br />
Much more, King Edward is my king:<br />
And before I'll hear him so wrong'd,<br />
I'll die within this place,<br />
And maintain good whatsoever I have said.<br />
And, if I speak not reason in this case,<br />
What I have said I'll maintain in this place.<br />
<br />
<i>Bon.</i> A pardon, my lord, for this Pinner;<br />
For, trust me, he speaketh like a man of worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Well, George, wilt thou leave Wakefield and wend with me,<br />
I'll freely put up all and pardon thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Ay, my lord, considering me one thing,<br />
You will leave these arms, and follow your good king.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Why, George, I rise not against King Edward,<br />
But for the poor that is oppress'd by wrong;<br />
And, if King Edward will redress the same,<br />
I will not offer him disparagement,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>But otherwise; and so let this suffice.<br />
Thou hear'st the reason why I rise in arms:<br />
Now, wilt thou leave Wakefield and wend with me,<br />
I'll make thee captain of a hardy band,<br />
And, when I have my will, dub thee a knight.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Why, my lord, have you any hope to win?<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Why, there is a prophecy doth say,<br />
That King James and I shall meet at London,<br />
And make the king vail bonnet to us both.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> If this were true, my lord, this were a mighty reason.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Why, it is a miraculous prophecy, and cannot fail.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Well, my lord, you have almost turned me.&mdash;<br />
Jenkin, come hither.<br />
<br />
<i>Jen.</i> Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Go your ways home, sir,<br />
And drive me those three horses home unto my house,<br />
And pour them down a bushel of good oats.<br />
<br />
<i>Jen.</i> Well, I will.&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>]. Must I give these scurvy horses oats?<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Now list to me:<br />
Here in a wood, not far from hence,<br />
There dwells an old man in a cave alone,<br />
That can foretell what fortunes shall befall you,<br />
For he is greatly skilful in magic art.<br />
Go you three to him early in the morning,<br />
And question him: if he says good,<br />
Why, then, my lord, I am the foremost man<br />
Who will march up with your camp to London.<br />

But, good my lord, tell me true what the wise man saith.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> That will I, as I am Earl of Kendal.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Why, then, to honour George-a-Greene the more,<br />
Vouchsafe a piece of beef at my poor house;<br />
You shall have wafer-cakes your fill,<br />
A piece of beef hung up since Martlemas:<br />

A word in secret that concerns their lives.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Say on, my sons.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Father, I am sure you hear the news, how that<br />
The Earl of Kendal wars against the king.<br />
Now, father, we three are gentlemen by birth,<br />
But younger brethren that want revenues,<br />
And for the hope we have to be preferr'd,<br />
If that we knew that we shall win,<br />
We will march with him: if not,<br />
We will not march a foot to London more.<br />
Therefore, good father, tell us what shall happen,<br />
Whether the king or the Earl of Kendal shall win.<br />
<br />

The one Lord Bonfield, the other Sir Gilbert [Armstrong].<br />
<br />

His deep perceiverance should be such to know us.<br />
<br />
<i>Arm.</i> Magic is mighty and foretelleth great matters.&mdash;<br />
Indeed, father, here is the earl come to see thee,<br />
And therefore, good father, fable not with him.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Welcome is the earl to my poor cell,<br />
And so are you, my lords; but let me counsel you<br />
To leave these wars against your king, and live in quiet.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Nay, the end tries all; but so it will fall out.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> But so it shall not, by my honour Christ.<br />
I'll raise my camp, and fire Wakefield town,<br />
And take that servile Pinner George-a-Greene,<br />
And butcher him before King Edward's face.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Good my lord, be not offended,<br />
For I speak no more than art reveals to me:<br />
And for greater proof,<br />
Give your man leave to fetch me my staff.<br />

A wiser wizard never met you yet,<br />
Nor one that better could foredoom your fall.<br />
Now I have singled you here alone,<br />
I care not though you be three to one.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Villain, hast thou betray'd us?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Momford, thou liest, ne'er was I traitor yet;<br />
Only devis'd this guile to draw you on<br />
For to be combatants.<br />
Now conquer me, and then march on to London:<br />
It shall go hard but I will hold you task.<br />
<br />

<br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Camp of</i> <span class="smcap">King Edward</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">King Edward, James, King of Scots,
Lord Warwick, Cuddy</span>, <i>and</i> Train.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. Edw.</i> Brother of Scotland, I do hold it hard,<br />
Seeing a league of truce was late confirm'd<br />
'Twixt you and me, without displeasure offer'd<br />
You should make such invasion in my land.<br />
The vows of kings should be as oracles,<br />
Not blemish'd with the stain of any breach;<br />
Chiefly where fealty and homage willeth it.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Brother of England, rub not the sore afresh;<br />
My conscience grieves me for my deep misdeed.<br />
I have the worst; of thirty thousand men,<br />
There 'scap'd not full five thousand from the field.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Gramercy, Musgrove, else it had gone hard:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>Cuddy, I'll quite thee well ere we two part.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> But had not his old father, William Musgrove,<br />
Play'd twice the man, I had not now been here.<br />
A stronger man I seldom felt before;<br />
But one of more resolute valiance,<br />
Treads not, I think, upon the English ground.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> I wot well, Musgrove shall not lose his hire.<br />
<br />
<i>Cud,</i> An it please your grace, my father was<br />
Five-score and three at midsummer last past:<br />
Yet had King Jamy been as good as George-a-Greene,<br />
Yet Billy Musgrove would have fought with him.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> As George-a-Greene!<br />
I pray thee, Cuddy, let me question thee.<br />
Much have I heard, since I came to my crown,<br />
Many in manner of a proverb say,<br />
"Were he as good as George-a-Greene, I would strike him sure:"<br />
I pray thee, tell me, Cuddy, canst thou inform me,<br />
What is that George-a-Greene?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> Know, my lord, I never saw the man,<br />
But mickle talk is of him in the country:<br />
They say he is the Pinner of Wakefield town:<br />
But for his other qualities, I let alone.<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> May it please your grace, I know the man too well.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Too well! why so, Warwick?<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> For once he swing'd me till my bones did ache.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Why, dares he strike an earl?<br />
<br />
<i>War.</i> An earl, my lord! nay, he will strike a king,<br />
Be it not King Edward. For stature he is fram'd<br />
Like to the picture of stout Hercules,<br />
And for his carriage passeth Robin Hood.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>The boldest earl or baron of your land,<br />
That offereth scath unto the town of Wakefield,<br />
George will arrest his pledge unto the pound;<br />
And whoso resisteth bears away the blows,<br />
For he himself is good enough for three.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Why, this is wondrous: my Lord of Warwick,<br />
Sore do I long to see this George-a-Greene.<br />
But leaving him, what shall we do, my lord,<br />
For to subdue the rebels in the north?<br />
They are now marching up to Doncaster.&mdash;<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter one with the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Kendal</span> <i>prisoner.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
Soft! who have we there?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> Here is a traitor, the Earl of Kendal.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Aspiring traitor! how darest thou<br />
Once cast thine eyes upon thy sovereign<br />
That honour'd thee with kindness, and with favour?<br />
But I will make thee buy this treason dear.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Good my lord,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Reply not, traitor.&mdash;<br />
Tell me, Cuddy, whose deed of honour<br />
Won the victory against this rebel?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> George-a-Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> George-a-Greene! now shall I hear news<br />
Certain, what this Pinner is.<br />
Discourse it briefly, Cuddy, how it befell.<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> Kendal and Bonfield, with Sir Gilbert Armstrong,<br />
Came to Wakefield town disguis'd,<br />
And there spoke ill of your grace;<br />
Which George but hearing, fell'd them at his feet,<br />
And, had not rescue come into the place,<br />
George had slain them in his close of wheat.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> But, Cuddy,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>Canst thou not tell where I might give and grant<br />
Something that might please<br />
And highly gratify the Pinner's thoughts?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> This at their parting George did say to me:<br />
"If the king vouchsafe of this my service,<br />
Then, gentle Cuddy, kneel upon thy knee,<br />
And humbly crave a boon of him for me."<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Cuddy, what is it?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> It is his will your grace would pardon them,<br />
And let them live, although they have offended.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> I think the man striveth to be glorious.<br />
Well, George hath crav'd it, and it shall be granted,<br />
Which none but he in England should have gotten.&mdash;<br />
Live, Kendal, but as prisoner,<br />
So shalt thou end thy days within the Tower.<br />
<br />
<i>Ken.</i> Gracious is Edward to offending subjects.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> My Lord of Kendal, you're welcome to the court.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Nay, but ill-come as it falls out now;<br />
Ay, ill-come indeed, were't not for George-a-Greene.<br />
But, gentle king, for so you would aver,<br />
And Edward's betters, I salute you both,<br />
And here I vow by good Saint George,<br />
You'll gain but little when your sums are counted.<br />
I sore do long to see this George-a-Greene:<br />
And for because I never saw the north,<br />
I will forthwith go see it;<br />
And for that to none I will be known, we will<br />
Disguise ourselves and steal down secretly,<br />
Thou and I, King James, Cuddy, and two or three,<br />
And make a merry journey for a month.&mdash;<br />
Away, then, conduct him to the Tower.&mdash;<br />
Come on, King James, my heart must needs be merry,<br />
If fortune makes such havoc of our foes. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

Say, good Marian, why art thou so sad?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Nothing, my Robin, grieves me to the heart<br />
But, whensoever I do walk abroad,<br />
I hear no songs but all of George-a-Greene;<br />
Bettris, his fair leman, passeth me:<br />
And this, my Robin, galls my very soul.<br />
<br />
<i>Rob.</i> Content: what recks it us though George-a-Greene be stout,<br />
So long as he doth proffer us no scath?<br />
Envy doth seldom hurt but to itself;<br />
And therefore, Marian, smile upon thy Robin.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Never will Marian smile upon her Robin,<br />
Nor lie with him under the greenwood shade,<br />
Till that thou go to Wakefield on a green,<br />

So will I wend with Robin all along,<br />

Bend up your bows, and see your strings be tight,<br />
The arrows keen, and everything be ready,<br />
And each of you a good bat on his neck,<br />
Able to lay a good man on the ground.<br />
<br />
<i>Scar.</i> I will have Friar Tuck's.<br />
<br />
<i>Much.</i> I will have Little John's.<br />
<br />
<i>Rob.</i> I will have one made of an ashen plank,<br />
Able to bear a bout or two.&mdash;<br />
Then come on, Marian, let us go;<br />
For before the sun doth show the morning day,<br />
I will be at Wakefield to see this Pinner, George-a-Greene.<br />

<p>[<i>Scene changes to the town's end</i>].</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we are at the town's end, what say you now?</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Marry, come, let us even have a bout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Ha, stay a little; hold thy hands, I pray thee.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Why, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Faith, I am Under-pinner of a town, and there is
an order, which if I do not keep, I shall be turned out
of mine office.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> What is that, sir?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Whensoever I go to fight with anybody, I use to
flourish my staff thrice about my head before I strike,
and then show no favour.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Well, sir, and till then I will not strike thee.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, sir, here is once, twice:&mdash;here is my hand,
I will never do it the third time.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> Why, then, I see we shall not fight.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Faith, no: come, I will give thee two pots of the
best ale, and be friends.</p>

<p><i>Shoe.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Faith, I see it is as hard to get water out
of a flint as to get him to have a bout with me: therefore
I will enter into him for some good cheer.&mdash;My
friend, I see thou art a faint-hearted fellow, thou hast no
stomach to fight, therefore let us go to the ale-house and
drink.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, content: go thy ways, and say thy prayers,
thou 'scapest my hands to-day. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Geo.</i> Tell me, sweet love, how is thy mind content?<br />
What, canst thou brook to live with George-a-Greene?<br />
<br />
<i>Bet.</i> O, George, how little pleasing are these words!<br />
Came I from Bradford for the love of thee,<br />
And left my father for so sweet a friend?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>Here will I live until my life do end.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Happy am I to have so sweet a love.&mdash;<br />
But what are these come tracing here along?<br />
<br />

</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Robin Hood, Maid Marian, Scarlet</span> <i>and</i>

<p>
<i>Geo.</i> Back again, you foolish travellers,<br />
For you are wrong, and may not wend this way.<br />
<br />
<i>Rob.</i> That were great shame. Now, by my soul, proud sir,<br />
We be three tall<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> yeomen, and thou art but one.&mdash;<br />
Come, we will forward in despite of him.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Leap the ditch, or I will make you skip.<br />
What, cannot the highway serve your turn,<br />
But you must make a path over the corn?<br />
<br />
<i>Rob.</i> Why, art thou mad? dar'st thou encounter three?<br />
We are no babes, man, look upon our limbs.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Sirrah, the biggest limbs have not the stoutest hearts.<br />
Were ye as good as Robin Hood and his three merry men,<br />
I'll drive you back the same way that ye came.<br />
Be ye men, ye scorn to encounter me all at once;<br />
But be ye cowards, set upon me all three,<br />
And try the Pinner what he dares perform.<br />
<br />
<i>Scar.</i> Were thou as high in deeds<br />
As thou art haughty in words,<br />
Thou well might'st be a champion for the king:<br />
But empty vessels have the loudest sounds,<br />
And cowards prattle more than men of worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Sirrah, darest thou try me?<br />
<br />
<i>Scar.</i> Ay, sirrah, that I dare.<br />

Thou art the stoutest champion that ever I<br />

<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Soft, you sir! by your leave, you lie;<br />
You never yet laid hands on me.<br />
<br />

And go with me?<br />
Two liveries will I give thee every year,<br />

And welcome, you my friends. Will you to my poor house?<br />
You shall have wafer-cakes your fill,<br />
A piece of beef hung up since Martlemas,<br />
Mutton and veal: if this like you not,<br />
Take that you find, or that you bring, for me.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>At Bradford.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">King Edward</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">King James</span> <i>disguised;
each carrying a staff.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. Edw.</i> Come on, King James; now we are thus disguis'd,<br />
There's none, I know, will take us to be kings:<br />
I think we are now in Bradford,<br />
Where all the merry shoemakers dwell.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter several</i> Shoemakers.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>First Shoe.</i> Down with your staves, my friends,<br />
Down with them.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Down with our staves! I pray thee, why so?<br />
<br />
<i>First Shoe.</i> My friend, I see thou art a stranger here,<br />
Else wouldst thou not have question'd of the thing.<br />
This is the town of merry Bradford,<br />
And here hath been a custom kept of old,<br />
That none may bear his staff upon his neck,<br />
But trail it all along throughout the town,<br />
Unless they mean to have a bout with me.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> But hear you, sir, hath the king granted you
this custom?</p>

<p>
<i>First Shoe.</i> King or kaisar, none shall pass this way,<br />
Except King Edward;<br />
No, not the stoutest groom that haunts his court;<br />
Therefore down with your staves.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> What were we best to do?<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> Faith, my lord, they are stout fellows;<br />
And, because we will see some sport,<br />
We will trail our staves.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Hear'st thou, my friend?<br />
Because we are men of peace and travellers,<br />
We are content to trail our staves.<br />
<br />
<i>First Shoe.</i> The way lies before you, go along.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span>, <i>disguised.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Rob.</i> See, George, two men are passing through the town,<br />
Two lusty men, and yet they trail their staves.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Robin, they are some peasants trick'd in yeoman's weeds.&mdash;<br />
Hollo, you two travellers!<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Call you us, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Ay, you. Are ye not big enough to bear<br />
Your bats upon your necks, but you must trail them<br />
Along the streets?<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Yes, sir, we are big enough; but here is a custom kept,<br />
That none may pass, his staff upon his neck,<br />
Unless he trail it at the weapon's point.<br />
Sir, we are men of peace, and love to sleep<br />
In our whole skins, and therefore quietness is best.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Base-minded peasants, worthless to be men!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>What, have you bones and limbs to strike a blow,<br />
And be your hearts so faint you cannot fight?<br />
Were't not for shame, I would drub your shoulders well,<br />
And teach you manhood 'gainst another time.<br />
<br />
<i>First Shoe.</i> Well preach'd, Sir Jack! down with your staff!<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Do you hear, my friends? an you be wise, keep down<br />
Your staves, for all the town will rise upon you.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Thou speakest like an honest, quiet fellow:<br />
But hear you me; in spite of all the swains<br />
Of Bradford town, bear me your staves upon your necks,<br />
Or, to begin withal, I'll baste you both so well,<br />
You were never better basted in your lives.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> We will hold up our staves.<br />
[<span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span> <i>fights with the</i> Shoemakers, <i>and
beats them all down.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> What, have you any more?<br />
Call all your town forth, cut and longtail.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a><br />
[<i>The</i> Shoemakers <i>recognise</i> <span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>First Shoe.</i> What, George a-Greene, is it you? A plague found<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> you!<br />
I think you long'd to swinge me well.<br />
Come, George, we will crush a pot before we part.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> A pot, you slave! we will have an hundred.&mdash;<br />
Here, Will Perkins, take my purse; fetch me<br />
A stand of ale, and set in the market-place,<br />
That all may drink that are athirst this day;<br />
For this is for a fee to welcome Robin Hood<br />
To Bradford town.<br />
[<i>The stand of ale is brought out, and they fall a-drinking.</i><br />
Here, Robin, sit thou here;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>For thou art the best man at the board this day.<br />
You that are strangers, place yourselves where you will.<br />
Robin, here's a carouse to good King Edward's self;<br />
And they that love him not, I would we had<br />
The basting of them a little.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Warwick</span> <i>with other</i> Noblemen,
<i>bringing out the</i> King's <i>garments; then</i> <span class="smcap">George-a-Greene</span>
<i>and the rest kneel down to the</i> King.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. Edw.</i> Come, masters, ale&mdash;fellows.&mdash;Nay, Robin,<br />
You are the best man at the board to-day.&mdash;<br />
Rise up, George.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Nay, good my liege, ill-nurtur'd we were, then:<br />
Though we Yorkshire men be blunt of speech,<br />
And little skill'd in court or such quaint fashions,<br />
Yet nature teacheth us duty to our king;<br />
Therefore I humbly beseech you pardon George-a-Greene.<br />
<br />
<i>Rob.</i> And, good my lord, a pardon for poor Robin;<br />
And for us all a pardon, good King Edward.<br />
<br />
<i>First Shoe.</i> I pray you, a pardon for the shoemakers.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> I frankly grant a pardon to you all:<br />
[<i>They rise.</i><br />
And, George-a-Greene, give me thy hand;<br />
There's none in England that shall do thee wrong.<br />
Even from my court I came to see thyself;<br />
And now I see that fame speaks naught but truth.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> I humbly thank your royal majesty.<br />
That which I did against the Earl of Kendal,<br />
'Twas but a subject's duty to his sovereign,<br />
And therefore little merits such good words.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> But ere I go, I'll grace thee with good deeds.<br />
Say what King Edward may perform,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>And thou shalt have it, being in England's bounds.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> I have a lovely leman,<br />
As bright of blee as is the silver moon,<br />
And old Grime her father will not let her match<br />
With me, because I am a Pinner,<br />
Although I love her, and she me, dearly.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Where is she?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> At home at my poor house,<br />
And vows never to marry unless her father<br />
Give consent; which is my great grief, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> If this be all, I will despatch it straight;<br />
I'll send for Grime and force him give his grant:<br />
He will not deny King Edward such a suit.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jenkin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Ho, who saw a master of mine? O, he is gotten
into company, an a body should rake hell for company.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Peace, ye slave! see where King Edward is.</p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> George, what is he?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> I beseech your grace pardon him; he is my
man.</p>

<p><i>First Shoe.</i> Sirrah, the king hath been drinking with
us, and did pledge us too.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Hath he so? kneel; I dub you gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>First Shoe.</i> Beg it of the king, Jenkin.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I will.&mdash;I beseech your worship grant me one
thing.</p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> What is that?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Hark in your ear.
[<i>Whispers</i> <span class="smcap">K. Edw.</span> <i>in the ear.</i></p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> Go your ways, and do it.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Come, down on your knees, I have got it.</p>

<p><i>First Shoe.</i> Let us hear what it is first.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Marry, because you have drunk with the king,
and the king hath so graciously pledged you, you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
be no more called Shoemakers; but you and yours, to
the world's end, shall be called the trade of the Gentle
Craft.</p>

<p><i>First Shoe.</i> I beseech your majesty reform this which
he hath spoken.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I beseech your worship consume this which he
hath spoken.</p>

<p>
<i>K. Edw.</i> Confirm it, you would say.&mdash;<br />
Well, he hath done it for you, it is sufficient.&mdash;<br />
Come, George, we will go to Grime, and have thy love.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I am sure your worship will abide; for yonder is
coming old Musgrove and mad Cuddy his son.&mdash;Master,
my fellow Wily comes dressed like a woman, and Master
Grime will marry Wily. Here they come.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Musgrove</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cuddy; Grime, Wily</span> <i>disguised
as a woman,</i> <span class="smcap">Maid Marian</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bettris</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>K. Edw.</i> Which is thy old father, Cuddy?<br />
<br />
<i>Cud.</i> This, if it please your majesty.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Musgrove</span> <i>kneels.</i><br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Ah, old Musgrove, stand up;<br />
It fits not such grey hairs to kneel.<br />
<br />
<i>Mus.</i> [<i>rising</i>]. Long live my sovereign!<br />
Long and happy be his days!<br />
Vouchsafe, my gracious lord, a simple gift<br />
At Billy Musgrove's hand.<br />
King James at Middleham Castle gave me this;<br />
This won the honour, and this give I thee.<br />
[<i>Gives sword to</i> <span class="smcap">K. Edw.</span><br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Godamercy, Musgrove, for this friendly gift;<br />
And, for thou fell'dst a king with this same weapon,<br />
This blade shall here dub valiant Musgrove knight.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span><i>Mus.</i> Alas, what hath your highness done? I am poor.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> To mend thy living take thou Middleham Castle,<br />
And hold of me. And if thou want living, complain;<br />
Thou shalt have more to maintain thine estate.&mdash;<br />
George, which is thy love?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> This, if please your majesty.</p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> Art thou her aged father?</p>

<p><i>Grime.</i> I am, an it like your majesty.</p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> And wilt not give thy daughter unto George?</p>

<p><i>Grime.</i> Yes, my lord, if he will let me marry with this
lovely lass.</p>

<p><i>K. Edw.</i> What say'st thou, George?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> With all my heart, my lord, I give consent.</p>

<p><i>Grime.</i> Then do I give my daughter unto George.</p>

<p>
<i>Wily.</i> Then shall the marriage soon be at an end.<br />
Witness, my lord, if that I be a woman;<br />
[<i>Throws off his disguise.</i><br />
For I am Wily, boy to George-a-Greene,<br />
Who for my master wrought this subtle shift.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> What, is it a boy?&mdash;what say'st thou to this, Grime?<br />
<br />
<i>Grime.</i> Marry, my lord, I think this boy hath<br />
More knavery than all the world besides.<br />
Yet am I content that George shall both have<br />
My daughter and my lands.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Now, George, it rests I gratify thy worth:<br />
And therefore here I do bequeath to thee,<br />
In full possession, half that Kendal hath;<br />
And what as Bradford holds of me in chief,<br />
I give it frankly unto thee for ever.<br />
Kneel down, George.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> What will your majesty do?<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Dub thee a knight, George.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> I beseech your grace, grant me one thing.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span><i>K. Edw.</i> What is that?<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Then let me live and die a yeoman still:<br />
So was my father, so must live his son.<br />
For 'tis more credit to men of base degree,<br />
To do great deeds, than men of dignity.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Well, be it so, George.<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> I beseech your grace despatch with me,<br />
And set down my ransom.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> George-a-Greene,<br />
Set down the King of Scots his ransom.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> I beseech your grace pardon me;<br />
It passeth my skill.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> Do it, the honour's thine.<br />
<br />
<i>Geo.</i> Then let King James make good<br />
Those towns which he hath burnt upon the borders;<br />
Give a small pension to the fatherless,<br />
Whose fathers he caus'd murder'd in those wars;<br />
Put in pledge for these things to your grace,<br />
And so return.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> King James, are you content?<br />
<br />
<i>K. James.</i> I am content, an like your majesty,<br />
And will leave good castles in security.<br />
<br />
<i>K. Edw.</i> I crave no more.&mdash;Now, George-a-Greene,<br />
I'll to thy house; and when I have supt, I'll go<br />
To ask and see if Jane-a-Barley be so fair<br />
As good King James reports her for to be.<br />
And for the ancient custom of <i>Vail staff</i>,<br />
Keep it still, claim privilege from me:<br />
If any ask a reason why, or how,<br />
Say, English Edward vail'd his staff to you.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All this be heard three witty young men,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">as he sat under a thorn, &amp;c.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now turn again, turn again, said the pindèr,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">for a wrong way you have gone, &amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For you have forsaken the king's high-way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and made a path over the corn, &amp;c.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And there they fought a long summer's day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">a summer's day so long, &amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till that their swords on their broad bucklèrs,</span><br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Nash repeatedly bears witness to Greene's popularity. "In a
night and a day would he have yarkt up a pamphlet as well as in seven
year, and glad was that printer that might be so blest to pay him
dear for the very dregs of his wit" (<i>Strange News</i>). Harvey condemns
him for "putting forth new, newer, and newest books of
the maker" (<i>Four Letters</i>). Greene remained popular long
after his death. In Sir Thomas Overbury's "Character" of <i>A
Chambermaid</i>, he tells us "She reads Greene's works over and
over"; and Anthony Wood informs us that since Greene's time
his works "have been mostly sold on ballad-mongers' stalls."
In the introduction to Rowland's <i>'Tis Merrie when Gossips meete</i>
(1602), (<i>Hunterian Club Publications</i>, vol. i.) there is a dialogue
indicating that Greene's works are still in demand. Ben Jonson
in <i>Every Man out of his Humour</i> (1599) alludes to Greene's works,
whence one "may steal with more security," referring undoubtedly,
as does Rowland, to the great mass of Greene's published work.</p></div>

praise the mountain that in seven years brings forth a mouse, or the
Italianate pen, that of a packet of pilfries, affordeth the press a
pamphlet or two in an age, and then in dignified array, vaunts
Ovid's and Plutarch's plumes as their own; but give me the man,
whose extemporal vein in any humour, will excel our greatest art
master's deliberate thoughts; whose invention quicker than his
eye, will challenge the proudest rhetorician, to the contention of
like perfection, with like expedition."&mdash;(Prefatory Address to
Greene's <i>Menaphon</i>.)</p></div>

most horrible cosenages of the common Conny-catchers, Coseners,
and Cross-biters, which I have indifferently handled in those my

discourses will do great good, and be very beneficial to the commonwealth
of England."&mdash;<i>The Repentance of Robert Greene.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It is regretfully that one recognises that Collins does not belong
at the head of this list. The surprising defects of the long-awaited

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> <i>Menaphon</i> was probably written a year or so earlier, but
Nash's address was probably dated from the year of publication.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> If we are to believe that <i>Edward III.</i> is Marlowe's play the
reference of this passage to Marlowe is made certain, for Greene
ridicules the words 'Ave Cæsar' that occur in the play. The
only other play in which the words are known to occur is <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> by Greene himself. It would be too much to say that
their use there is in ridicule of Marlowe, though even that is
possible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It may be, though it is not certain, that Greene was attacking
Marlowe in the epistle prefixed to his <i>Farewell to Folly</i> (1591), in
which he tells the gentleman students that his <i>Mourning Garment</i>
had been so popular that the pedlar found the books "too dear for
his pack, that he was fain to bargain for the life of Tomliuclin to
wrap up his sweet powders in those unsavoury papers." If
"Tomliuclin" is a misprint for Tamburlaine this is Greene's most
direct and spiteful attack on Marlowe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Greene's satirical use in <i>Never too Late</i> of the words "Ave
Cæsar," which occur in <i>Edward III.</i>, Act i. Sc. I, and his connecting
of them with a cobbler, seem to constitute Fleay's case.
The matter has already been mentioned in connection with Greene's
jealousy of Marlowe. The latest editor of <i>Edward III.</i>, C. F.
Tucker Brooke, in <i>The Shakespeare Apocrypha</i>, ignores the supposition
that the play may be by Marlowe and dismisses the theory
that it was by two hands. He puts forward the claims of Peele,
not, however, with great weight.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Though we accept the theory of the early composition of <i>A
Looking-Glass</i> we fail to follow the arguments of Fleay and Gayley,
derived from the introduction of <i>Perimedes</i> (licensed 29th March
1588), that in "the mad priest of the sun," mentioned in connection
with Atheist Tamburlaine, Greene can have any reference to the
priests of Rasni in Act iv. Scene 3. Certainly Greene could not have
held up such tame heroics for comparison with Marlowe's vigorous
declamation. Careful scrutiny fails to show that Greene was
mentioning a work of his own. The mad priests of the sun would
seem rather to be other products of the pen of Marlowe, or to be
the work of some other dramatist, possibly Kyd, whom, with
Marlowe, Greene was attacking. (<i>See</i> Koeppel in Herrig's <i>Archiv</i>,
102, p. 357.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Particularly the parts of Adam, Smith, and Alcon. It is hard
to suppose that Spenser in his line, "pleasing Alcon," in the <i>Tears
of the Muses</i> (1591), could have been referring to Lodge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> As to date of the play we can say only that if Greene's it must
be the last one of his extant workmanship. It would not be safe
to draw conclusions from the mention of <i>George-a-Greene</i> in Tarlton's
<i>News out of Purgatory</i>, as Tarlton was probably alluding to the
source of the narrative used by Greene. Nor does the mention of
"martial Tamburlaine" in the first scene help further than to
indicate that the play was written after 1587.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This name was, however, quite common in this sense, Peele
himself using it in his <i>Farewell</i> and in <i>Polyhymnia</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The reference is to the edition in <i>The Shakespeare Apocrypha</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Compare this with a line in <i>James IV.</i> (Act ii. Sc. I). "Better,
than live unchaste, to lie in grave."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> <i>See</i> Gayley, <i>Representative English Comedies</i>, p. 422. Opinion
to-day seems strongly to favour the theory that it was Nash to
whom Greene referred in the famous passage in <i>A Groatsworth of
Wit</i>, and not Lodge. Considerations of age, of personal association,
of the comparative gifts of satire of Nash and Lodge strengthen
this view. Nash helped Marlowe in the composition of a tragedy;
why not Greene in the composition of a comedy?</p></div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
